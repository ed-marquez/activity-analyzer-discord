then, you get CID of that metadata json and you send this CID as bytes to mint function 

That being said it is my understandgin that you *could* probably mint NFT with metadata directly buffered but youhave a 100B limit 😄 which i slike barely a URL string of data , hence why the recommended approach is to put json somewhere and only pass a link for it to minter","",""

basically what it means is the amount of h/tinybars charged for the transaction exceeds the amount you are setting (or the default if you don't explicitly set it). This can happen due to changes in your code (e.g. you change some values, add extra signatures, etc) or it can also happen due to external factors like the price of HBAR changing.

To fix it you need to add `.setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(anAmountInHbarYouAreWillingToPay))`. The idea is that should the price of HBARs drop massively in USD you wont end up draining your account of HBARs because the cost of transactions increased 10x for example (even though the USD cost is the same)","",""

The pattern I use for most of my transactions is this:
- set up the transaction
- set any generic things (e.g. setMaxTransactionFee, setMemo)
- set the specific values needed for this transaction (so in your case set all of the transfers, in an account create set the keys and initial balance, etc)
- then you need to sign and/or freeze depending on how you are gathering the signatures (this bit can get pretty complicated if you are doing things like having multiple separate humans sign, but for your test I'd just do both signatures yourself at first and worry about the rest later)

As for the undefined error you'd need to add more details.

So in a script it can look like this

const txResponse = await transaction.execute(client);

//Get the transaction ID
const transactionId = txResponse.transactionId;

//Get the account ID of the node that processed the transaction
const nodeId = txResponse.nodeId;

//Get the transaction hash
const transactionHash = txResponse.transactionHash;

hethers is an adaptation of ethers.js, and those properties/concepts of `adminKey`, `autoRenewalAccount`, `autoRenewPeriod`, and `expirationTime` are not a thing in other chain and tools. 

**The only way that I'm aware of to pay rent for those contracts is from the balance of the contracts themselves** (e.g. transfer HBAR to the contract OR make the contract charge a fee per operation to accumulate an HBAR balance).

I'm working on a project that we have some cases that will need to have consecutive transactions.

For Example:
I have a KYC'ed account but the token manager figured out strange behaviour and he wants to remove the KYC from that account. After some investigation he wants to wipe out the tokens.

To wipe the tokens I'm granting KYC back (executing the transaction) wiping the account (executing the transaction) revoking KYC again (executing the transaction)

I created an account with a key list (3 keys) on TESTNET.
I'm following this documentation to sign a multi-sig transaction:
https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/transactions/sign-a-multisignature-transaction

I don't understand why I need to configure the client with a default private key? Why, when all keys need to sign the transaction?

Thanks, any help greatly appreciated.","",""
"168749001850486784","RaphaelM#1144","03/15/2023 5:13 AM","Hey ! 
So you need to configure the client with a default privateKey because the client is the account who will pay for the transaction.
Let's say you want to transfer an NFT from an account to another to do so you need to sign the transaction with the account sending the NFT but this account  could be different from the operator, in this case the operator will pay for the transaction but we still need to sign the transaction by the sender.
Also something that could be interesting to explore is that you can set a threshold key, in your case you've define a account with 3 keys but I don't know if you have set a threshold, if not,  all signatures are required to sign the transaction from this account. 
If you create a threshold you can specify that only 1 of 3 is needed to sign the transaction.

I hope you're having a great weekend.
I am trying to deploy a solidity smart-contract on hedera with a bytecode data above 6kb.
I check this post on stackoverflow and I have to use ContractCreateFlow() method but I don't know how I should handle the signature of this contract.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72406476/getting-error-transaction-oversize-while-creating-a-smart-contract-in-hedera-b

Is there a sample code from gihub also (I don't see)?

https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/blob/main/examples

my code:
    const operatorId = AccountId.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_ID);
    const operatorKey = PrivateKey.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_PVKEY);
    const client = Client.forTestnet().setOperator(operatorId, operatorKey);
    const transaction = new ContractCreateFlow()

                                .setBytecode(bytecode)
    //Sign the transaction with the client operator key and submit to a Hedera network
    const txResponse = transaction.execute(client);

    //Get the receipt of the transaction
    const receipt = (await txResponse).getReceipt(client);
    const fileId2 = receipt.fileId;

I am trying to create an initial test account with balance using the official docs (TestNet). I am using Typescript :
`
 const newAccountPrivateKey = await PrivateKey.generateED25519()
const newAccountPublicKey = newAccountPrivateKey.publicKey

this.newAccount = await new AccountCreateTransaction()
  .setKey(newAccountPublicKey)
  .setInitialBalance(Hbar.fromTinybars(1000))

setPayableAmount syntax is:

setPayableAmount(amount: number | string | Long | BigNumber | Hbar): ContractExecuteTransaction;

I had assumed that 'BigNumber' is HBAR expressed in tinyvalue. This assumption worked in other places.

When I pass the tiny value represented as a BigNumber, setPayableAmount treat it as a HBAR value not Tinybar value so I got a 'INSUFFICENT_PAYER_BALANCE' 
 
```
const inputTinyValue = BigNumber(100_000_000); //1 hbar

//Doesn't work, 'INSUFFICENT_PAYER_BALANCE'
const contractExecuteTx = new ContractExecuteTransaction()

- the contract must own the tokens (Contract A)
- the approval must be created by the token owner (contract A) and be given to the spender (contract b)
- Contract B can now spend contract A's token (contract B sends contract A's NFT to user)
- when Contract B sends the Contract A's NFT to a receiver, the receiver must have the token associated
 
Please ensure all accounts are associated and approvals have the expected owner/spender
You can check if the approvals have the expected owner/spender by going to owner(contract A) account on hashscan. 
You can check if an account is associated with a token id by going to an accounts page on hashscan and looking at balances. If associated you will see the token ID with a balance of 0 or greater.

**Note:**
In order to associate a token to a Contract or grant an allowance from a Contract you will need to use their admin key. Reference: https://hedera.com/blog/how-to-send-and-receive-hedera-tokens-using-smart-contracts-part-1-sdks#:~:text=4.%20Associate%20Token%20and%20Remove%20the%20Admin%20Key
