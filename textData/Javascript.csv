First thing the browser needs to do is send it to your extension to sign it. That's already something like a local webserver. Next thing is that the extension needs to send it somewhere else because it cannot talk gprc,  a proxy (either the extension sends or te orignal javascript does - either way a proxy is needed). That proxy hopefully will be at site.com's server otherwise my transaction is going to take detours and this makes me feel uneasy (auditor too). Thus, the location of the proxy needs to be either on HH's network, if that doesn't work on site.com's network, if that doesn't work on localhost and if that doesn't work ... on hash-hash. haha","",""

You're right that there is a dependency in grpc-web for now.

I believe you can let DragonGlass know of your contract and its token name so they will list it.

#3. How to create multiple public address from the same account id? I have heard hedera supports 16 K addresses but don‚Äôt know how to create this much of address.

The CryptoCreate API enables you to create as many accounts as you need.

#4. Can anyone briefly outlined the major differences between Hedera Hashgraph and Ethereum for deploying ERC20 smart contract token? What are the limitations in Hedera?

The first is that events are recorded as records (can be seen in mirror node) as opposed to the blockchain
The second is state size for a smart contract is limited in Hedera whereas I believe it's unlimited on Ethereum","","üëç (1)"

Should you not be transferring the token to Hedera as a whole and have your investors use new Hedera accounts ? If not, they won't be able to sign for transactions to transfer tokens in/out/within the contract. 
If they approved you (or someone else) with a Hedera account to perform actions on their token balances on their behalf, you might be able to hold an array of Hedera vs Ethereum addresses as a mapping. Otherwise I'm not sure how it would work, maybe someone more familiar with tokens across platforms can suggest something here.

```
Use webpack to produce a web-worker bundle and run that bundle in a web-worker separte from the RN process
This is best practice regardless as you want to keep the UI thread clear of anything non-UI

With HCS, there isn't anywhere on the ledger that is going to store your funds in it's state ""on-chain"" like a smart contract would. If you wanted to do something like this you would have to build with specific accounts and facilitate those deposits/redemptions ""off-chain"" in some manner, and use the history of messages in HCS to trigger events. So there are surely some things more easily done with a contract than HCS (by itself) - however, the blog post linked above discusses how you could use HCS as part of a larger architecture (with Hyperledger Fabric, etc.) which could run solidity, or something similar, to store stateful contracts, if you wanted to continue down that route.

A receipt should be available within the transaction valid duration window (max 2 minutes). If it hasn't arrived by then, it never will. However, if it hasn't arrived after 10s, it doesn't mean it won't arrive after 15. So if you don't wait for the full 2minutes, you'll never know if your tx was successful or not.

An alternative might be to decouple sending the tx and getting the receipt, maybe even skipping getting the receipt and relying on a mirror node to get the result of your transaction.

Just some thoughts","",""

Currently I assume the tx goes through (it's a micropayment HCS message), the system caches the charge locally, and the cache is frequently replaced by mirror node updates so if the tx failed then the balance will automatically adjust (in favour of the user)

Later I can do some stress testing over different time windows and see how things play out. There might be a business decision about how many charges to let drop and how to present to the user.","",""

@raf hey raf, I responded to your private message, but you should be able to fetch historical transaction records from a mirror node REST API like DragonGlass, Kabuto, or Armanino's Trusted Node.

In Ethereum there are two ways of interacting with a smart contract: transactions and calls.

Calls are possible only for function which are marked as pure or view. If you issue a call to such function the result is fetched directly from the node which you are connected to - the actual blockchain is not involved. Your node should have the most recent data (if it's synchronized) so there's no need to consult the actual blockchain. These kind of operations are always read-only operations. Calls do not cost any gas.

The other way to interact with a smart contract is by a transaction. They are used for changing the state but also for reading the state. Basically a transaction is used for anything which is not a read-only operation and which needs to go to the blockchain.```","",""

Even filtering on the function name would be a risk, who knows what solidity code hides behind `getBalance` ;)

1) To run own instance of blockchain with full access, we need to deploy both mainnet and mirror nodes? 
If I understood clear, the mainnet node suits only for creating accounts/broadcasting transactions and such operations, and if you want to get data such as account balance, transaction receipt - you need mirror node for that purposes?
2) I found that there are official public mainnet and mirror nodes, but the mirror one is for whitelisted partners only?
3) As I see, transaction fees consist of 2 parts: node fee and network fee. Is there a way to obtain it's actual values from somewhere? Like, for example, ethereum gas price can be obtained from https://ethgasstation.info/ api.
4) Fees must be payed for almost every operation on network, but using mainnet node? If you use mirror node to get any data you don't have to pay fees, right?","",""
"474151701138505739","rhysied#6748","07/24/2020 12:14 PM","hi @Daniel.n 
1) Only council members run mainnet nodes atm, although in the future it will be opened out to others (first trusted parties, then eventually the general public). You don't need to deploy your own mainnet OR mirror node if you don't want to. All state-affecting changes need to be sent to at least one mainnet node, whilst mirror nodes can be used to query the state of the network and avoid having to pay the fees associated with asking a mainnet node
2) Anyone can run a mirror node now via GCP (see: `https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/mirror-node-public/hedera-mirror-node`)
3) There is a rather large and complex function that goes into calculating the fee paid for a transaction, but the best place to look for when trying to get an estimate of what you might end up spending is the estimator tool (see: `https://www.hedera.com/fees#estimator`). The fees are all pegged to USD values based on the HBAR/USD exchange rate so whilst the actual fee paid may be slightly different you should always pay roughly the same amount in USD terms. 

Also, before you submit a transaction, you can in most instances (afaik) call a `cost` function which will estimate roughly how much you will pay
4) Fees are paid for pretty much everything aside from a simple `getBalance`, `getReceipt` and `cost` queries afaik. Everything else you would have to pay for on the mainnet, however you can get around paying for some state queries like `getRecord` if you get the data from a mirror node instead (`app.dragonglass.me` and `kabuto.sh` both have APIs you can use for free (atm anyway))","",""

"474151701138505739","rhysied#6748","07/24/2020 12:43 PM","I cant remember if the fee updates every hour but its certainly at least once a day, however the fluctuations should be fairly small.

"736173290707484673","Daniel.n#4971","07/24/2020 12:48 PM","So that means that, for example, simple hbar transfer transaction would be always almost with the same fee value and it's allright to predefine some value that is little bit bigger than current fee?","",""
"474151701138505739","rhysied#6748","07/24/2020 12:52 PM","yeah, so with your transactions you must set a maxFee you are willing to pay, which you can then use to ensure that should their be a sudden drop in the price (I believe the fee adjustments are smoothed to avoid any sudden spikes either way) you dont burn through all of your HBAR.

The main thing to remember is:
HBAR price goes up in USD, you pay fewer tinybars for transactions.
HBAR price goes down in USD, you pay more tinybars for transactions.
Whatever happens to the HBAR price, your transactions still cost roughly the same in USD (e.g. cryptotransfer is $0.0001)","",""

@Anemesis I don't believe so, since the operator is the ""Hedera account"" which is paying the transaction fees (meaning it can't be null). Depending on your needs you could explicitly call .build() and then .sign() the transaction with another key, or the key from another account. Or you could dynamically configure a new client connection just for the one transaction (if you want them to sign/pay the fees for that tx). But maybe someone else in the chat has additional context/details/experience with whatever your usage needs are.","",""

@Dan-E - have you attempted to explicitly `.build()` the transaction with your client, then `.sign()` the transaction with the private key of whoever you'd like the transaction to come from? This isn't a 1:1 example, but shows how you can use one client to build a transaction then sign it with another key https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/blob/6187eeacddb7fbfda395e6ba865ece0845764eb6/examples/update-account-public-key.js#L49 Alternatively you could likely actually dynamically instantiate a new client with whoever the tx is supposed to be coming from, and then the build/sign step happens ""behind the scenes"" with the SDK.

You should be able to take the Hedera API message definitions (.proto files) and compile them to a low level C library which you can then use in your code. There really should be no need to concern yourself with the inner workings of protocol buffers.

And for additional third party compilers (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/docs/third_party.md)

In the mean time, you should be able to use cookies in a browser app, maybe with a little encryption so the data in the cookie isn't clear text, or if mobile, use the hardware encryption (not all mobiles) to encrypt/decrypt the private key so it's not kept in plain text.

(there may be other ways, I'm unfortunately not a web/mobile security expert).

In the SDKs examples, there is an example of how to create a transaction, convert it to a byte array and pass it to a client to sign (the server creates the TX, gives it to the client which signs) and return to the server (or the client can send to Hedera direct)

js: sign-transaction.js

Generally an exchange would wait for a certain number of blocks before it records a token transfer as a deposit to one of its addresses. This wait for a few more blocks to get created ensures that the block under process is immutable. 

What I am doing right now is fetching the list of all txns of my address periodically, and keep processing(updating my db) new txns, if any.  For any other coin I use the block number as a metric to ensure the txn's immutability. I check if the a substantial amount of blocks have been created after the block in which the txn under process is present. 

How do I emulate it in hedera? Or is it the case that once a txn is written on to the DLT, it is immutable immediately.","",""

Let's say alice want to send bob some tokens (without marketplace). The one paying has to sign with her private key then pays the fees also.
Or as alternative the operator pays the fees if there is no .sign()
I've seen no other choice than the execute(client) // being client the operator, i guess it makes sense as the privatekey is needed
?

You do this with vuex-persist store variables, storing the keys in the clients (meaning user). Right?
Are there any alternatives to this? It seems it would be a cumbersome stuff to ask everytime for a key of such length, even with mnemonic tricks. But it doesnt feel like an optimal solution either.

Is there a type of recover-my-password for such keys? (Please provide doc links if so)

2.-Side question: The fees are always in hbars, independent of the tokens value?

How would one best implement a topic as a queue? (last added message is the latest enqueued entry, and messages that are first in sequence can be dequeued/popped)
My understanding now is that messages can never be updated, so I cannot dequeue a specific message by updating it's metadata or smth
My current idea is therefore to maintain the actual sequence number of the entry that is next in line, inside the topic memo. So for example my topic is named: Telephone Queue #15. Message A which has sequence nr. 15 is processed, so I update the topic memo to: Telephone Queue #16.

So messages remain on a mirror node forever, when you subscribe you can specify the point in time after which you want to receive notifications for new messages. 

This enables you to catch up with past messages while your application was down. I usually persist the consensus timestamp of the last message I processed and re-start subscription on that timestamp + 1 nano second.","",""

topic 1 contains the queue in order by sequence nr
topic 2 contains an entry with the hash of each queue entry that has been processed
topic 1 - topic 2 entries = the actual queue

I think there will still be some issues with this in the long run, when topic 2 will grow too long and I can't query all entries. Until I find a better way, this is how I'll go at it.

It doesn't mean everyone has to process the messages, but the fact that it's possible for someone to see what's happened could be enough of a deterrent to process the messages unfairly.

You could also use the messages to prove that Alice applied for housing at time T (consensus timestamp) and that if her application isn't processed by time T+processing time, she has reason to believe she's not being treated fairly.","",""

If I wanted to make a simple website that allowed visitors to browse and then purchase (using HBAR) digital NFT art, what is the best way to architect the interaction with the Hedera Hashgraph SDK?

1) allow the user to just paste their key in to sign a transaction (bad for the user's security, many users will not trust this system)
2) use the SDK to generate a transaction which can then be converted to bytes, handed off to the user to sign, with the return bytes then processed (quite complex, need to develop or use an existing signing tool, limitations around the time between generating the bytes, signing and submitting)
3) build in support for one of the Hedera browser extensions (only downside being none of them seem to have become the defacto one to use, not sure about how much interoperability there is or whether each one needs a bespoke integration, no mobile support?)
4) leverage the new scheduled transaction feature to generate the purchase transaction and let the user sign it asynchronously (only downsides here are potentially you may waste money on fees if users keep cancelling orders, also not sure how much third party support their is for it yet)","",""

I've briefly looked at Hex for this purpose, does anyone know of any other options?
I will now give your option 4 more thought as I like the idea of not needing to deal with the users private key.

To clarify, with scheduled transactions the intention is that you would be able to create a swap (e.g. my 10 HBAR for your NFT). Without scheduled transactions you would need to sign this with both keys, however with scheduled transactions you can set up the transfer (i.e. the NFT will be swapped for 10 HBAR) and sign it, where it is then published to the network (I think there is an upper limit on how long they last but can't remember it ATM, not sure if it's 24 hours or several days).

As a user (potentially via your dapp interface or via a wallet, this is where the ecosystem needs some time to develop), I will see the transaction is waiting for my signature, sign it and then push it back to the network where it can execute in the same manner as if both keys were provided at the start","",""

https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/javascript/create-an-account#step-2-generate-keys-for-the-new-account
- I see Hedera Requires an operator to initialize the account on Hedera. Now the implementations I saw for this require the account ID and the private key of the operator to be sent to the node for the first transaction. 
#1 - Does the SDK sign the transaction before sending it to the node?
#2 - What to do if our private key for the operator is in a Hardware Security Module?
#3 - Is there a reason why Hedera does not use addresses generated by the private key but needs the account ID returned by the ""create account"" transaction? It kind of poses a hindrance if a use case is only for airgapped modules (but I do get a lot of blockchains like to do reveal transactions) but in this specific case you cannot even get back the address to say do the transaction at a later time i.e. you would need to store the signed transaction right?

Imagine I have a website with a simple javascript game on it. For the POC, I would like to allow anyone to come to the site, pay some small amount of HBAR and then get access to the game.
If the user leaves and comes back I'd like the site to recognize the user already paid (looking up something on a  mirror node?) and allow them to just play the game without further payment.
I'd like to do this without storing anything outside the ledger/hyper-graph.

1. Is this possible?

1. AccountId.fromString and PrivateKey.fromString have to be used. Cooper's video is a little bit old so be careful with the new syntaxes. once I changed the constructors with these functions they worked fine. 
2. the tokenID can be identified with the let token = ""x.x.xxx"" command
3. if you created a token already and need to find the tokenids you can do that by doing an accountqueryinfo which will fetch all the tokenrelationships with a specific account
4. remember to add the adminkey when creating a token. this will be needed in case you want to delete it.
5. tokens can be created with the same name and symbol. keep this in mind when moving to the mainnet. 
basic lessons learned that maybe could save 1 or 2 days for newbies like me. thanks Rocket!","","üëç (4)"

There's nothing in the SDKs to choose between http/1.1 and http/2, so if those errors occur, it could be due to something between the client and Hedera that translates http/1.1 to http/2.

Transaction history is an interesting one, firstly I like to think that history on blockchains isn't so much a feature as a byproduct of security. With blockchain, history is what enables security, without it, you cannot be sure any block is as it should be, and that's also because most blockchains don't have finality of transactions, finality gets nearer 100% as the transaction is buried deep within the blockchain (like min 6 blocks), but technically, that transaction is never 100% final, a reversal of the chain is always possible (hard, but possible).

Hedera transactions are 100% final, there is no way to roll them back, so history isn't strictly necessary from a node/consensus point of view.

There are also space considerations for nodes, the current history of Hedera transactions is several terabytes already and we're just ticking over. At 10,000 tps we'll be producing 247Gb of transaction data per day (assuming a 300byte transaction and not including transaction records). This amount of data is too much to expect a node to hold, so we have mirror nodes which are readonly nodes which will process transactions to consensus from gossip (like consensus nodes) and will be able to store the history of transactions they're interested in (e.g. your accounts, your topics, etc...). Mirror nodes may offer services to hold data their subscribers are interested in too.

For now, mirror nodes get transaction data via files we host on S3 and GCP, they are able to fully verify the files have not been tampered with.

We will also have state proofs (our mirror does beta state proofs) which are a small payload of data with which you can prove the existence of a transaction, account balance at a time. State proofs can be verified off chain and even remain valid if Hedera no longer exists.","",""

Am I correct in that WRT the JS sdk, the process for minting a non-fungible token is the same as a fungible token?

For example, I have unique data that I'm publishing to ipfs. I have my ipfs url that I want to assign to my NFTs (Ethereums way of doing this is having the URI function in the standard). Does Hedera have any way to associate the IPFS metadata to the NFTs? I see that I can set a `memo` on the `createToken` transaction but that feels like I'm assigning the ipfs hash to that trasnaciton instead of the NFTs. If that is indeed the only way to associate the ipfs hash to the NFTs, is there no way to assign individual metadata to an individual NFT token instead of the NFT token set as a whole?","",""

Your code above looks ok, however you may as well just call `PrivateKey.generate()` if you're not using the mnemonics.

When a key is generated a secure random number is generated first, and a key generated using that number (this happens transparently when you call `PrivateKey.generate()`

To make key recovery easier for users, it's possible to translate the random number into a set of words (mnemonics) so that if the key is lost/forgotten, the random number used to generate it can be recovered from the mnemonics and the original key can be generated from the random number. Mnemonics are easier to type than a long private key...

Therefore, the only reason you'd use `Mnemonic.generate()` in the first place is to output the resulting words to the end user so they can write them down for subsequent key recovery.

Note: recovery only works if
* The algorithm to translate mnemonics to random number is the same during recovery and generation
* The algorithm to get a key from a random number is the same during recovery and generation

It is therefore recommended to store the private key as well as the mnemonics in a safe location just in case the mnemonics-based recovery is somehow jeopardised. A private key will always work (as long as it matches the public key known to Hedera)","",""

Furthermore, an account can be associated to a list of public keys meaning every key has to sign, or a threshold list which is a list where say 5 of 10 have to sign. All these can be nested too !

Right, there are three endpoints which aren't working very well and result in an RST_STREAM error which the SDK doesn't handle (even v2.1.1), if you override the SDK's default list of nodes as follows you should be ok. I've tried them all individually and they work fine.

We know `from` address and treasury account `0.0.98` and need to distinguish node address from `to` address. Recently the list of official nodes updates very quickly, from `0.0.6 - 0.0.12`, to `0.0.6 - 0.0.20`, to `0.0.6-0.0.26`.

We need to be very up to date with the list of nodes. Since the request to query list of nodes costs money, we cannot use it very often, therefore we do not plan to use it at all.

From our observation, the official node account increments sequentially, so is there a number of accounts reserved for official nodes, say less than 100?

Or, is there a correct way to keep updated on the list of nodes?","",""

some very early transfers (before Open Access iirc) we're made directly to the nodes if you look at the full history, however if you are only concerned about a subset of transfers related to your activity on the network ignoring everything <100 isnt a bad idea atm (in fact given we would be limited to 39 council member nodes until permissioned nodes are allowed you could actually just ignore < 42)","","üëç (1)"

In any case, it worked for me (after reproducing the error). Here's what's going on:
- Since your NFT has a custom fee associated with it, the recipient also needs to sign the transaction (because they are paying something). So if you add **.sign(recipientPrivateKey)** after freezeWith(client), then it will work.
- If your NFT did not have custom fee, then what you have will work as is

1. There needs to be an additional `.setFeeCollectorAccountId(feeCollectorAccountId)` added for the `CustomRoyaltyFee()` function for the Javascript and Java examples.

2. `setFeeCollectorAccountId` is stated as *required* here: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/tokens/custom-token-fees#methods but the following code doesn't throw an error when we create an NFT without is set on the nested `CustomFixedFee()` function.:
```
  const feeCollectorAccountId = AccountId.fromString(""0.0.123456"");
  const royaltyFee = new CustomRoyaltyFee()

    .setDenominator(10)

JavaScript is single threaded (although it can be made to look asynchronous). I suspect you need to run different clients in different processes to achieve high throughput, although I'd still expect to see errors rather than no completion at all.

So, it possible to transfer to 0.0.26574578 instead of 0.0.26574575 by mistake (typo).
We recently introduced a checksum which adds a few letters to an an account id such that it can be validated against the network on which the accountId exists, for example

For example: 0.0.12344 on testnet resolves to 0.0.12344-ztpck, whereas on mainnet it resolves to: 0.0.12344-dmqow. This would mean that attempting to transfer to the first accountId+checksum on mainnet would fail since the checksum doesn't match.

Equally 0.0.12345 resolves to 0.0.12345-lwnwn on mainnet, so someone mistyping 0.0.12345-dmqow would see an error since the checksum doesn't match that account id on mainnet.

This is an early design decision which makes sense for some keys, if you had a freeze key and frozen accounts, unsetting the key would mean these accounts would be frozen for ever, unless a check is made which could be costly in terms of performance...

On a more technical level, protobuf doesn't encode nulls meaning the node receiving the transaction doesn't get ""null"", it gets nothing/not set (protobuf removes all ""unnecessary"" data in order to be as efficient as possible).

then compute the exchange rate as such:

and the current exchange rate I see on coinmarketcap.com is 0.2227 (the hedera network only computes the rate 1/hour and as an average of multiple exchanges so the slight discrepancy is expected).

The root of the trouble is big numbers and the implementation of Google's gRPC tooling.  Int64 sized numbers can not be represented in native javascript.  The grpc tooling provides an option for using a 3rd party ""long"" package that works both in node and in the browser.  Long is a pain to work with, but it gets the job done (beware even with long, JSON serialization still looses precision, don't go there, transfer numbers in decimal string notation if you value balancing the books)

With that said, I've had considerable trouble getting the bundlers to work with the way @Hashgraph/sdk pulled in these dependent libraries - I don't think this is the sdk's fault, I think this is gRPC toolings fault - but nonetheless, rollup just can't seem to produce a bundle that works inside the web context.  It does not surprise me that you would have to elevate the tooling to webpack.

Inside the node.js context, everything seems to work quite well, as long as you remember to import the Long properly (yes, I burned 2 hrs yesterday 'cause I screwed that up).","",""

```
    // generate a transaction id
    const transactionId = TransactionId.generate(process.env.OPERATOR_ID);
    // execute the transaction
    const response = await new AccountCreateTransaction()
        .setTransactionId(transactionId)
        .setInitialBalance(new Hbar(1)) // 10 h
        .setKey(newKey.publicKey)
        .execute(client);

    // get the receipt
    const receipt = await response.getReceipt(client);

    console.log(`account id = ${receipt.accountId.toString()}`);

    // get the record
    const transaction = new TransactionRecordQuery()

        .setIncludeDuplicates(true);

    const record = await transaction.execute(client);
    console.log(record.receipt.status);
```
which works just fine.
However, if I query for a record using your transaction Id, I get a DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION error too.

I suspect this is because that transaction id is unknown to the node you're sending the query to. Note that consensus nodes don't hold onto every transaction for ever, they only retain approximately 3 minutes of transaction history. So if you query for a transaction Id that's older, you won't get any information for that transaction. In this case you should be getting ""UNKNOWN"", not sure why the error is incorrect. Will raise an issue.

Also note that getReceipt for a transaction id that's no longer known by the network may return UNKOWN to the SDK. The SDK will keep trying until it times out (approx 2 minutes) since if you submit a transaction to Node A and immediately ask for a receipt from Node B, it's possible Node B has not yet been made aware of the transaction via gossip. It would then report ""UNKNOWN"". The SDK then waits a short time and tries again, if by that time Node B is aware of the transaction, it will respond accordingly.","","üëçüèº (1)"

Others create a new Hedera account for each customer to avoid using memos (and the typos that can happen there). Once hbar is transferred to the customer's hedera account (the exchange has custody of the keys), it can transfer to a pool account while maintaining the customer's balance in the exchange's database.

the correct thing of doing this is that you have a STAGING/PREVIEW enviroment, where you can your new features and we all can test them out, but this cannot be testnet man!!

The other option is to roll something on your own like  https://hashgraph.bugbytes.com/callcontract page does, it sends the bodybytes of the contract over to the user, which are signed and sent back the form of a protobuf encoded sigmap (sorry this is in the weeds) which is then stitched back together on the web server and sent to hedera.  The trick is to not change the bodybytes in any way when passing to different parties to sign (freeze accomplishes this I think).

What i am trying to do: Deploy and Interact with a deployed smart contract using Hether.js.
What works so far: deploying to testnet works. I can view the contract at dragonglass testnet explorer.
What doesn't work so far: Trying to interact with the deployed code.

What i have done so far to rectify it:
1. I Created a testnet account at: ``https://portal.hedera.com/register`` and tried to follow the guide. I ran into the  error below when I was trying to deploy the compiled solidity contract.  I assumed it was because the testnet account isn't of type ECDSA: 
``` reason: 'transaction 0.0.34362732@1651502272.242593353 failed precheck with status INVALID_SIGNATURE',
  code: 'INVALID_SIGNATURE',```
2. After running into error above, I Created a new ECDSA accountId and Private Key using: ```PrivateKey.generateECDSAAsync();```, the contract deployed correctly and while trying to interact with it, I ran into the error below: 

```TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_code')

Currently, I'm stuck on signing Tx part with error: INVALID SIGNATURE.

Here are the steps I followed to create an account Id and sign a payload. 

1. By using KMS public key I have a created account id.

    let kmsPub = await getPublicKey();
    let res = EcdsaPubKey.decode(kmsPub.PublicKey, 'der');
    let pubKeyBuffer = res.pubKey.data;
    let publicKeycompressed = ec.keyFromPublic(pubKeyBuffer, 'hex').getPublic(true, 'hex');
    var publicKey33Bytes = decode(publicKeycompressed.toString(""hex""))
    let publicKeyECDSA = PublicKey.fromBytesECDSA(publicKey33Bytes);
    const newAccountPublicKey = publicKeyECDSA

2. In transactionSigner function for ECDSA i did this:

async function transactionSigner(bytesToSign) {
    console.log(""Signing transaction in transactionSigner"");
    const msg = encode(bytesToSign);
    const data = decode((0, _keccak.keccak256)(0x${msg}));
    let signature = await findHederaSig(data, ""kmsKeyId"");
    const rrr = signature.r;
    const sss = signature.s;
    let rrr1 = rrr.toArray(""be"", 32)
    let sss1 = sss.toArray(""be"", 32)
    const result = new Uint8Array(64);
    console.log(result)
    result.set(rrr1, 0);
    result.set(sss1, 32);
    console.log(result)
    return result;
}

4. findHederaSig():
async function findHederaSig(plaintext, keyId) {
    let signature = await kmssign(plaintext, keyId);
    let decoded = EcdsaSigAsnParse.decode(signature.Signature, 'der');
    let r = decoded.r;
    let s = decoded.s;
    let secp256k1N = new bn(""fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141"", 16);
    let secp256k1halfN = secp256k1N.div(new bn(2)); 
    if (s.gt(secp256k1halfN)) {
        s = secp256k1N.sub(s);
        return { r, s }
    }
    return { r, s }

Things seem to work pretty well if you're using the Hedera SDK on the backend. The challenge, however, is getting things to work fine in the frontend; the current tools seem not have fully covered that domain.

StratoJS for instance (among other challenges) isn't able to call non-state-changing functions; that capability hasn't been implemented yet as it's still in development. One can't even retrieve deployed contracts with Hethers because it's incompatible with HashConnect's signer object; and HashConnect is the only library I know of that's currently available for interacting with the HashPack wallet. I did finally get to interact with my contract today using Hedera SDK in tandem with HashConnect's signer object, but the wall I've run into now is that Hedera SDK seems not work for querying smart contracts via the `executeWithSigner` option.

I've since developed my smart contract and deployed it, and built my frontend as well.

Reverts that are not related to that are currently trickier to debug. You may need to simplify and deploy multiple times until you find the issue. There are some traceability improvements coming that will make debugging much easier (I believe in v0.26 or shortly after). 
For listening to events, you can do that with libraries like hethers, ethers, or web3 js.

For display a NFT Gallery, talking about what would be better and also to improve times.... what would be better?

Make a query using:

```js
const query = new AccountInfoQuery()
    .setAccountId(newAccountId);
```

Or... use the API

```https://mainnet-public.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.693645/nfts/```

If I use `AccountInfoQuery()` do It have any cost? Can I see the Metadata from one NFT with `AccountInfoQuery()` ? Also... If I use the **API** , in how many time will be updated since anybody create a **NFT** ? 

Also... when I use the API , It returns **Metadata** and I need decrypt with **Base64** which way would you recommend to do this?

Thanks in advance!","",""

Not sure I fully understand this question. If you're asking how long it takes between minting an NFT and it displaying on the API it's around 5 - 10 seconds.

For base64 decoding you can do this:

```const data = ""YmFma3JlaWNqZXMzY3h1a3Rmam9kc2FvZTZ3aDd3ZmhseGJ4NWk0eW1yZm14eW51ZXZocDJqMmJkN2k=""

You can setup a testnet client like this: `const client = Client.forTestnet()`. Then you need to setup an operator (who pays for your transactions) by creating a .env file in your working directory and insert the credentials of your testnet account that you can get here: https://portal.hedera.com/register,
if you want to know how to setup your environment check this doc page:  https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/environment-set-up

Note that once you have an operator, if you want, you can create other account using AccountCreateTransaction() and by specifying a private key as parameter. You can generate a Private Key like this: `const newAccountKey = PrivateKey.generateED25519()`

Hello, in my company we are investigating how to add Hedera to our marketplace and I have doubts on how to implement it.
In my first place we have a Factory contract, and on the other hand the token contract, an ERC721.
Is there any example of how to do this? I have tried using the SDK with the account I created, but it tells me that the contract exceeds the allowed limit.
The Discord forum talks about splitting the contract into small chunks, but I haven't found an example of how to do it.

To distinguish between NFTs and fungibles you need to look at the `type` field which is `NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE` and iirc FUNGIBLE_COMMON for fungible tokens.

Just to clarify, the current mirror node system uses two different type of files to update, there are record stream files which contain the transactions themselves (these take roughly 5 seconds after consensus time to reach mirrors), and the balance files which update 15 minutes. `/v1/api/balances` uses the balance files, whereas most of the other mirror API queries use the record stream data (afaik), so unless you are checking for tokens within 10 seconds or so of the token create transaction being submitted the mirror should have your data","",""

Then it protobuffs the whole transaction and sends it off to a Node for processing. I have not looked through the Node code yet, but I guess at some point the node then calls something on chain. (feel free to correct me if any of that was incorrect). 

1) Does the Node logic at some point end up calling an ERC20/721 standard compliant function on a contract somewhere (ie. transferFrom() https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) ? 

I want to implement my own ERC721 contract so I can override the transfer function and ensure my contract is informed anytime a transfer of an NFT occurs.

"429323958592995328","Greg Scullard#5365","07/13/2022 7:52 AM","Great questions !

1) if you're using native tokens (or hbar), no contract is ever invoked. These are all stored and maintained in Hedera's own state, separate from contracts (which is how we get the speed and low cost of such transfers).
2) if you implement your own contract, you won't be able to invoke it as part of a CryptoTransfer transaction, you'll have to call the contract itself
3) It works the other way round, you can't use a contractId and make it looks like a token, on the other hand a native token's address (0.0.xxxx converted to a solidity equivalent using the SDK) will look like another ERC20/721 to a contract.

Note: Mirror nodes keep track of every transaction, you can query transactions per NFTId (https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/tokens/0.1.2/nfts/1) which would be the equivalent of querying contract events.
There isn't a higher level API to track per tokenId unfortunately, the only other alternative is to query for CRYPTOTRANSFER Transactions and parse them to see if your token is included in the transaction.

"474151701138505739","rhysied#6748","07/14/2022 10:08 AM","with the new staking update I'm a bit confused with some of the functionality. We want to support both nodes and custom accounts but not sure how much difference it makes which function you use to set it as part of the account update.

Looking at github, it looks as though `setStakedNodeId()` takes an int (e.g. I want to stake to node 5 a.k.a. 0.0.8 aka Google's node)
```
    /**
     * @param {Long | number} stakedNodeId
     * @returns {this}
     */
    setStakedNodeId(stakedNodeId) {
        this._requireNotFrozen();
        this._stakedNodeId = Long.fromValue(stakedNodeId);

        return this;
    }
```

`setStakedAccountId()` takes the account ID format
```
    /**
     * @param {AccountId | string} stakedAccountId
     * @returns {this}
     */
    setStakedAccountId(stakedAccountId) {
        this._requireNotFrozen();
        this._stakedAccountId =
            typeof stakedAccountId === ""string""
                ? AccountId.fromString(stakedAccountId)
                : stakedAccountId;

        return this;
    }
```

If I use setStakedAccountId to set the account as 0.0.8 or does that mean I'm using indirect (the account I stake to receives rewards but I dont receive anything unless they share) staking rather than direct (I receive staking rewards directly assuming I don't decline them) node staking? also will I need to detect account IDs that represent nodes and convert them to the node ID?","",""

- Correct, that would result in indirect staking. That's always the case when you use that function.

- Based on the info I have atm, yes, when staking to a node you specify a number, not an ID.

According to that link, you can generate a transaction ID in various ways, and in one of those ways, you can pass a valid start. 
The transaction valid start time is the time the transaction begins to be processed on the network. The transaction valid start time can be set to a future date/time.
So the **valid start** and the **valid duration** (180 seconds max) can both be set and give the time and window for which the transaction is valid.

"474151701138505739","rhysied#6748","07/26/2022 4:11 AM","you could potentially create and freeze the transaction for some time in the future, but you'd still be limited to the 3 minute validity window from that time (e.g. I create bytes for 1st Jan 2030 00:00:00, it'd still need to be signed and submitted by 00:03:00). 

For long periods like this there could be other issues like changes in keys if its a multiparty transaction, changes in the underlying protobufs or just other general issues like network downtime. If future transactions are something you are particularly interested in I'd have a look at scheduled transactions (`https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/scheduled-transaction`) which I think are limited to a few days or potentially you might be better looking at a smart contract for logic that spans months / years

edit: sorry, may have missed the point of what you were saying. Most of the time people leave them as the default values, but essentially for your transaction you have the transaction_valid_start time which is the timestamp included in the transaction ID after the @ , and you also have the transaction_valid_duration field which can be up to 180 seconds (I was incorrect earlier when I said it was 2 minutes). So regardless of when you set the valid_start time for (as long as its in the future), you are still limited by the valid_duration window (which iirc is a limitation based around how long transaction records are kept in memory on the consensus nodes)","","üî• (1),üíØ (1)"

I've run into that invalid signature issue with hethers when using the ED25519... keys, given that those are the Hedera default.

A function like below may be of help. The first step is to generate the ECDSA keys, and then create the account using that key:

`const aliceKey = PrivateKey.generateECDSA();

So far I've found that with `hashconnect` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/hashconnect) I'm able to establish the connection with my wallet and create pairing string, topic etc. Also I'm able to create the provider and signer. At the same time they are refers to Wallet Provider feature: https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-338 and to hethers package for contract's interaction: https://docs.hedera.com/hethers/getting-started

So for example in regular dApp in Ethereum you create the provider/signer utilising metamask and then you are able to sign the transactions while interacting with you smart contracts (which have been initialized with ethers.js or web3).

What is not clear for me in Hedera ecosystem, should I use `hashconnect` instances together with `hethers`? If I want to have an instances of my contracts and then be able to sign them with my wallet (which is hashpack). In tutorials I found that hethers is used for contracts deployment with hardhat, while if you want to interact and sign contracts - you should use hashconnect and use hedera SDK directly (and call ContractExecuteTransaction/ContractCallQuery...).

Am I able to do similar like I do with metamask and ethers?
```
const wallet = (window as any).ethereum; // this is metamask
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(this.wallet);

const signer = this.provider.getSigner();

const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  contractAbi,
  signer,
);

// call and sign my contract's transactions
```

Or it's not the case for Hedera? If you have any references with such kind of questions being answered, please share. Any help would be very appreciated. 

Eventually, I have to add Hedera support with hashpack wallet to existing dApp,  with tons of contracts interactions with `ethers`, and I'm not sure if I'll have to rewrite all the interactions or could I just have a bridge with `hethers`.","",""

- Manually: if an account, let's say, Alice, wants to transfer a token to Bob, she can't unless Bob performs a TokenAssociateTransaction of the token ID that Alice is trying to transfer.

-Automatically: An account can set a number of automatic token associations, so you can avoid using a TokenAssociateTransaction.

Check here: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/tokens/associate-tokens-to-an-account

Token KYC is used when you need your token to be used only by specific accounts.

I have deployed my main contract using the Hedera SDK, and the second one using solidity.
I'm now trying to associate the first smart contracted (created using the SDK) with my solidity smart contract and I'm getting an error.

This is the error I'm getting:

In hedera's case, if you're using the native token service, the minted tokens go to a treasury account  from which they can later be transferred to another account.
If you're using an ERC20 contract, minting will increase the total supply and you should also be able to transfer tokens from the contract to another address. You can (should) never have more than the total supply in circulation.","",""

For example, sending crypto to an Alias (eth key) that results in the creation of a new account - that create TX is a nested transaction.

With this tool, however, you can estimate fees for native services: https://hedera.com/fees
And then this same doc page gives you the formula to **estimate** gas: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/smart-contracts/gas-and-fees#gas-fees

After consensus you can get a transaction **record** and look at fees and gas paid there.

"474151701138505739","rhysied#6748","09/12/2022 8:21 AM","the price in HBAR for any non-free operation will adjust based on either the median / average price (cant remember which exactly) of HBAR vs USD on a selection of exchanges as the USD price of transactions remains constant (or thereabouts allowing some margin for error). You can see the USD price and an estimate of the current price of an operation on hedera.com/fees.

The idea behind the max transaction fee is that it allows you to limit how much HBAR you will spend if for some reason the price crashed. If you are always happy to pay the USD price, you can set maxTransactionFee to a high amount and let it roll on, or otherwise you will need to come up with the middle-ground where you are no longer prepared to pay the HBAR costs and therefore wont send any transactions until the HBAR USD price rises again","",""

Generally speaking for queries you can get an estimated cost beforehand iirc but tbh I dont query the mainnet aside from balances as you can get most of the data you need from mirror nodes.

Also when you send transactions the receipt usually contains the exchange rate used so you could monitor it as part of your ongoing transactions. Aside from that the best thing I guess would be to use data from CoinGecko / CMC as a guide however there have been issues with massive spikes in the past on CMC and potentially you may get mismatches as the exchange rate updates a few times a day rather than in real time, plus they have some smoothing (this all afaicr and also potentially has changed as the network has become more adopted)","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

```js
Client gives server 100 tokens and receives 1 nft

Client side:
let tokenTransferTx2 = await new TransferTransaction()
  .addNftTransfer(nftId, serialNumber, clientAccountId, serverAccountId)
  .addTokenTransfer(tokenId, clientAccountId, -100)
  .addTokenTransfer(tokenId, serverAccountId, 100)
  .freezeWith(clientClient)
  .sign(clientKey);

===> send transfer to server

Server side:
tokenTransferTx2Sign = await tokenTransferTx2.sign(serverKey);

let tokenTransferSubmit2 = await tokenTransferTx2Sign.execute(serverClient);
let tokenTransferRx2 = await tokenTransferSubmit2.getReceipt(serverClient); 
```

There are now two questions for me:
- Would it be possible to Switch the order of the two code blocks so that the server is the one creating the transaction and sends the created transaction to the client? Would that be a save approach or is it somehow possible to read private data from the server on the client?
- Is it possible on the server side to check how much token the client is sending me? I want to prevent that the client tries to manipulate the amount of tokens it sends so that the client receives a nft for less tokens

Both links above have examples for how you can perform the dapp-wallet pairing and instantiate signer/provider.

Hethers.js is cool and capable, but I would consider using the SDK and wallets above with libraries like Ether.js, and web3js.

In terms of workarounds for approved token transfers, see details in this other open issue: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/3758#issuecomment-1235559647

To summarize, the two ways atm to complete an **approved** token transfer are:
- doing a HAPI `TransferTransaction` if you're ok working with the SDK 
- using the `IERC20.transferFrom / IERC721.transferFrom` ERC standard calls if you prefer/need to do from Solidity

- https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/multi-sig-offline.js - this example shows how you can sign a transaction offline (locally) and submit it after all necessary signatures have been collected. I think you're already there, but sharing for awareness. 

- https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/transactions/modify-transaction-fields - from this documentation page, you can choose which node you submit a transaction to with the native SDKs. This could work if you don't need to use the JSON RPC Relay. Basically, when you're forming the transaction, use the `setNodeAccountIds` method to specify the node you want to send the tx to. I will say, that's not necessarily a best practice because if the node you chose is down, so is your application - the SDK handles this node selection automatically for you but you can still customize. After tx creation and signing, you can simply `execute` with a `client` or `signer`.","",""

};

export default connectToWallet;



When I run this i am getting error at executewithsigner 

Error : ""SimpleCrypto object MUST BE initialised with a SECRET KEY"" 

Expectation: to get a hashpack wallet popup similar to metamask asking for confirmation/ signature.

Is the approach i am taking for signing the transaction correct?  

If not , kindly help me!","",""

If so, we are working on a JSON-RPC relay (<https://hashio.io>) which is also open source in our github repo. Hedera's api isn't JSON/RPC so the relay adds the necessary api support for common ethereum libraries and tooling. It's work in progress, but the goal is to create parity as much as possible to ease the transition from other EVM compatible networks to Hedera.

In the mean time, you can use the Hedera SDKs to deploy and call contracts.

2. Not at the moment no, on Ethereum you can either run your own node to run queries against (which has a cost), or query third party services up to a point (they're usually freemium services with gas limits). When you query a consensus node, it's fair that the node should be paid for the CPU/memory it's using to respond to your query, otherwise it would be an easy attack vector (just keep spamming nodes with free queries).

We are working to enable this via mirror nodes which would mimic the third parties you're used to using (freemium/limited model).","",""

"429323958592995328","Greg Scullard#5365","11/25/2022 7:47 AM","Good questions, the smart contract programming model can be confusing at first. Generally a smart contract is code + data which is stored and runs on the ledger. What it does and how it works is entirely up to the developer developing it.

You could code a contract that holds token balances against a number of accounts, and only you have the authority to transfer tokens between accounts (msg.sender is typically used in a contract to check who's calling it). Usually though, the idea is that if I have tokens of my own (you transferred them to me) in a contract, only I am able to transfer them to someone else, but that's not a rule, it's your contract, you can do whatever you need to fit your requirements üòâ

The contract can't execute itself, someone has to ""call"" it and run one of its public methods, that's done either directly via a wallet application (you specify the address of the contract, the method you want to call and the parameters you want to pass), or via a web app/other which constructs the call, signs it (signs the transaction containing the call) using a wallet and sends it to Hedera for execution.

If you're only going to manage tokens, Hedera has a native token service (HTS) which is far more efficient (but not necessarily as flexible as a contract) and has a dedicated API in the SDK.","",""

The tutorial sets the private key in the client and broadcasts using that client.
e.g.
```
// Grab the OPERATOR_ID and OPERATOR_KEY from the .env file
const operatorId = AccountId.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_ID);
const operatorKey = PrivateKey.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_KEY);

// Build Hedera testnet and mirror node client
const client = Client.forTestnet();

// Set the operator account ID and operator private key
client.setOperator(operatorId, operatorKey);

//Create the transfer transaction
const sendHbar = await new TransferTransaction()
     .addHbarTransfer(myAccountId, Hbar.fromTinybars(-1000)) //Sending account
     .addHbarTransfer(newAccountId, Hbar.fromTinybars(1000)) //Receiving account
     .execute(client);
```

This time, we want to sign the transaction by an external mechanism and send it without setting the private key to the client in the code.

basically what it means is the amount of h/tinybars charged for the transaction exceeds the amount you are setting (or the default if you don't explicitly set it). This can happen due to changes in your code (e.g. you change some values, add extra signatures, etc) or it can also happen due to external factors like the price of HBAR changing.

To fix it you need to add `.setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(anAmountInHbarYouAreWillingToPay))`. The idea is that should the price of HBARs drop massively in USD you wont end up draining your account of HBARs because the cost of transactions increased 10x for example (even though the USD cost is the same)","",""

The pattern I use for most of my transactions is this:
- set up the transaction
- set any generic things (e.g. setMaxTransactionFee, setMemo)
- set the specific values needed for this transaction (so in your case set all of the transfers, in an account create set the keys and initial balance, etc)
- then you need to sign and/or freeze depending on how you are gathering the signatures (this bit can get pretty complicated if you are doing things like having multiple separate humans sign, but for your test I'd just do both signatures yourself at first and worry about the rest later)

As for the undefined error you'd need to add more details.

Hope that helps","",""

hethers is an adaptation of ethers.js, and those properties/concepts of `adminKey`, `autoRenewalAccount`, `autoRenewPeriod`, and `expirationTime` are not a thing in other chain and tools. 

**The only way that I'm aware of to pay rent for those contracts is from the balance of the contracts themselves** (e.g. transfer HBAR to the contract OR make the contract charge a fee per operation to accumulate an HBAR balance). That may be the same case for contracts deployed using things like `CREATE2` and a JSON-RPC relay with EVM libraries.","",""

I'm working on a project that we have some cases that will need to have consecutive transactions.

For Example:
I have a KYC'ed account but the token manager figured out strange behaviour and he wants to remove the KYC from that account. After some investigation he wants to wipe out the tokens.

To wipe the tokens I'm granting KYC back (executing the transaction) wiping the account (executing the transaction) revoking KYC again (executing the transaction)

My question is, Does hedera has some way to wrap those 3 transactions in only one?
