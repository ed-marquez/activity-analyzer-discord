So what I'm gathering is that if you are a client that needs to be inherently suspicious of what information is being returned to you by the mirror network (where the distrust is originating based on the Use Case requiring a very high degree of proof/accuracy/verifiability/etc.)

that you would have basically two options:

1. Operate your own internal mirror node, which would automatically and computationally verify all information coming to it from the consensus nodes, because this is just what mirror nodes are built to do. This would be the strongest guarantee.

or

2. Ask the same question of multiple independent mirror nodes. If you get the same answer from multiple, you could have higher trust in the response than if you just asked one.","","üëç (1)"

You might find this useful about how shards will talk to eachother (subject to chage of course):
`""Shards communicate through the exchange of messages between members of the different shards.
All such messages are push (rather than pull). Each shard (its members) maintains a queue of outgoing
messages to each of the other shards. Each shard remembers the sequence number of the last message
it processed from each of the other shards. A message is sent from shard Alpha to shard Beta by nodes
in Alpha randomly contacting nodes in Beta, to transfer the message, along with a proof that it is part of
the consensus state of the Alpha shard. They continue doing this until one of the Beta members replies
with a proof that the Beta shard shared state includes a sequence number indicating that this message
was received and processed. In this manner, transactions that impact addresses in different shards can
be appropriately recorded into each shards state, and so the entire state of the entire ledger.""`

If my dApp needs to make frequent **automated calls**, it would be inconvenient to ask the user to sign each transaction via Hashpack/Metamask/etc. One way to circumvent this, is to store the private key of the user's dApp account in an encrypted keystore and hold the key in memory as long as the app is running (and the user provided his password to decrypt the file at app launch). The user then only needs to transfer HBAR to this dApp account from his primary account to pay for fees.

However, since this comes with security risks and I wonder if there is a better way for a dApp developer that would not require an internal key handling? 

For example, is there something like a CryptoAllowance which makes it possible to grant a secondary account (i.e. the dApp) the right to make transactions only to **specific topics and smart contracts** and make the primary account pay for it? Or is there another way to handle the issue above, which does not involve managing the user's private key within the dApp?","",""

Imagine a kind of peer-to-peer network between users, where there is a constant automated communication between the dapp instances of each user's computer ... Maybe a specific example would be a decentralized eBay where users can specify a ""limit price"" they are willing to pay for an offered product. The users dApp runs in the background and should be able to sent automated bids to an HCS topic as long as the limit price is not reached (a smart contract would be too expensive, if you pay $0.05 per bid). That is not an ideal example, since there are other issues involved (e.g., when the dapp is not running, there would be no bids), but it should illustrate the overall issue.","",""

Maybe user prefunds (escrow) and external bot monitors, if there is a trade to make it touched the SC whihc executes and the user later comes ot collect.

Any external pieces can be centralized or decentralized (through time?) but you leave business logic protected in a Smart Contract to add rigour.

However, for the bidding part a SC is not ideal. Partially due to price, partially due to the polling issue. A HCS topic would be better for the bidding. The best scheme I can come up with is:
- a user has its actual funds in a dedicated wallet app which they register with a smart contract for fund withdrawal/deposit (that way the dapp has no private key for the user funds)
- dApp creates a separate Hedera account for the user upon registration which handles the automated calls like bidding

The dapp then would handle only the private key for the second account, which at least increases security. The remaining issue is, that the second account would still need enough HBAR to pay for the bidding process and other transactions. It would be nice if the user could set up an allowance for the second account to pay all transaction fees for the second account from the users primary account (in the best case: The user could define in the allowance exactly which topics and smart contracts they allow spending for) . But that seems to be impossible, right? 

If so, the user would need to transfer some hbar to the second account every few days leaving the risk for the dapp beeing hacked and the money allocated for the fees of the automated calls to be stolen.

Proxies don't determine (de)centralisation, they're a layer of protection for the nodes against certain types of DDoS attacks. Turning off a proxy is one way to disconnect a node from the public internet, same as pulling the network cable from a network card, disabling the network card itself at the operating system level, changing the IP address of the node, closing a port in a firewall, changing a route in a router, etc....","",""
