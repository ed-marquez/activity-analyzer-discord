"429323958592995328","Greg Scullard#5365","03/02/2020 8:53 AM","@Johnda98 so I think there are two approaches here:

-Private chain (pick your poison), uses HCS for consensus. The smart contract/chaincode/other-poison deployment happens in just the same way as it would with its native consensus, so you have the same execution logic everywhere. Benefits are lack of leader, fairness, speed, public network validation, etc...

-If I don't use a chain, but deploy an iOS/Android/... app, the same applies except that we depend on people upgrading to the latest version of the app in order to ensure same logic. Something could be coded into every message to indicate which minimum version of the app is necessary to interpret the message, thus enforcing an upgrade happens else messages are merely cached and not applied to state.

You  might argue the latter isn't decentralised. I look at it in two ways:
* Decentralisation of Compute - where does it run, single computer/virtual machine or many
* Decentralisation of Administration/Governance - who is in control of the software's operation (pause/unpause/upgrade)

An app available from an app store meets the `Compute` decentralisation aspect, an instance of the app runs on many devices at once, not a single one.

Smart contracts nowadays are more often than not deployed with admin functions to `pause` or `destroy` making the administration/governance centralised and in the hands of a single person/entity. Furthermore (as evidenced by the recent flash loan hack) they can also be updated by their owner meaning contracts of value/risk are no longer immutable.

How do you trust a smart contract today, how many are able to validate the code ? If my app was open source, could it be trusted in the same way ?

Reality is that running every possible smart contract in a serial manner on a single public network may be sustainable (remain to be seen), but is not scaleable or cost effective. App nets offer an alternative.","",""

Yes, I agree the semantics of a 'smart contract' can get lost in a technical sense.. the purpose we all know.. but one can loose sight of that.  of course no counter position here.. just a discussion..   Of course IF the bytcode is verified as matched and published and immutably tied to executing address.. then  IF there is a suicide/ admin Only Owner function in there  ..

Updated readme: https://github.com/hashgraph/fabric-samples-hcs/blob/feature/hcs/first-network/README_hcs.md

Suggestions:
-A clean clone of the repo with the head of branch feature/hcs (short git hash b13fa3d)

The failure is caused by `byfn.sh`  being unable to use the `hcscli` to generate the two required hcs topics (one for fabric system channel and the other for fabric application channel).

You can attempt to create the topics manually

`../bin/hcscli topic create 2`
 
and this is a good output:
 
```
$ ../bin/hcscli topic create 2
loaded configuration from file - ./hedera_env.json
new topic id: 0.0.194670
new topic id: 0.0.194671
```

If the manual run succeeds and the demo still fails, try to modify byfn.sh to add more debug messages, in the function generateChannelsForHCS at line 157.

Some ideas :

State Determination Function (SDF)
= function (HCS messaging stream)

This can be any script in any language (even plain English!) that exclusively takes HCS messages as input, and therefore produces a consensual output. The script itself can also be tied to HCS, and therefore be nested.
This is a read-only process that only requires mirror nodes. The script can be tied to HCS with a hash (signed maybe) or even included directly within the message (optionally encrypted and/or compressed)

Higher Order State (HOS)
= the output of SDF

This is maybe akin to an SQL view

Example state ""Alice owes Bob 10 hbar""

State Dependent Executor (SDE)
executes transactions on the Hedera network based on HOS. This can be a manual process (eg someone sending crypto), or automated via a smart contract or other automation tool.

Example execution ""Alice pays Bob 10 hbar""

maybe terms exist already but my background is not compsci so could be missing it.. let me knwo your thoughts..

For all practical purposes, it is an extra memo field.  Now SDKs have to support this in some fashion.  Embedding app specific n of m info in the message itself is more flexible, for example, maybe they don't want a correlation ID to be a transaction ID.  Maybe its an open-ended conversation and we don't know what M is.  If the chunk info is used, it reduces to max size of the message, so why not just leave it to the app to decide how to correlate chunks of a message?  

Yes, I know it is OPTIONAL, however its mere existence is an endorsement of ""this is the hedera way"" to do it.   But it does not provide value since it allows garbage in  (every app layer will have to go to some effort to validate after the fact).

I think it does maybe blur the lines between what the file service is best suited for vs what HCS is best suited for (i.e. if I have a file do I upload it as a file or serialise it into message chunks), although I'm assuming this has been done with a specific use case in mind that will perhaps clarify the decisions behind it.

The other thing is it does raise some ""philosophical"" questions about when events actually happened if, as mentioned, the first message chunk is submitted in one hour but the message isn't ""completed"" for several hours later.

The other questions I have is how this works behind the scenes in the database, so for example do the amount of chunks need to specified up front?

So in the case of the random lottery, assuming the nodes all have roughly the same latency when gossiping to other nodes through the network (i.e. outbound and inbound between any two nodes is roughly the same for X amount of bytes) then smart node selection could give you a significant advantage.

Also, I would assume that based on the size of the network and how fortunate you were in the random gossip selection you may get lucky if you reach a supermajority in a smaller geographic cluster (I'm guessing this would be where Leemon was talking about true RNG and that possibly gossip might not be absolutely random - although that is just a guess on my part)","",""

* All entities (accounts, topics, contracts, tokens) have to be paid for in order to remain on the network, they will otherwise get deleted automatically.
* The auto-renew account is the account that funds the renewal, renewal happens every auto-renew period for the same duration (e.g. every 3 months for 3 months).
* If the balance of the auto-renew account is insufficient to cover the period, the renewal will be whatever the account can pay for (e.g. could be 1 month although renewal period is 3).
* If the account is credited before the next expiry (1 month the above scenario), renewal will be automatic and the entity will remain on the ledger
* If the account balance is 0 at the time of renewal, the entity will be marked as deleted and eventually purged from the ledger for good.

Files are a little different in that you specify how long you want the file to be on the ledger when you create it. You can later extend that duration if you wish, otherwise the file will self-delete when the expiry date has passed.

Why do we do this ? Well, there is a cost to holding the data for these entities which nodes have to bear, a cost we acknowledged as soon as we launched the network, not a problem to solve later. Free for all works for a while, then either costs are added as an after-thought, or node operators start questioning whether they should keep holding data for free.

Note: There is a youtube video and blog  on our crypto economics that goes into the detail of how those fees are distributed, I'll dig them up if you're interested. Let me know.

Hope this helps.

I am using ""@hashgraph/sdk"": ""^1.4.4"", what I want is that I want to subscribe to a specific topic on which I can listen to events/messages coming while that subscriber is listening to all of those.

Like we have common pub/sub model where we can subscribe to a subject, and subscriber is actually sitting on message to invoke specific action for that subscriber.

I am writing a server that can actually subscribe to a given TOPIC and keep on listening to that TOPIC until or unless server is up. Sample Code I am using:

const myMirrorClient = new MirrorClient('hcs.testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com:5600')
new MirrorConsensusTopicQuery()
.setTopicId(TOPIC)
.subscribe(myMirrorClient,
    (messages) => console.log('messages', messages.toString()),
    (err) => console.log('Error',err.toString()));

This actually looks like a callback function and it gives me following error:

**Connection to dns:hcs.testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com:5600 at 34.69.90.179:5600 rejected by server because of excess pings. Increasing ping interval to 4000 ms**

The other option I think is like always listen to events like a node in the network, and on specific TOPIC do the action. But I don't have any Idea how this will work either. üòï 
And after this it does not even listen to any of published message.

please guide me what I am doing wrong or show me the right way.","",""

With my work with DOVU we are working on implementing various IWA specs and are developing a certified carbon methodology with the National Farmers Association in the UK, the core of which is contained with audit process leveraging dynamic NFTs (HCS + HTS + IPFS).

1024 bytes/characters or 200-250 words is likely to not be enough, especially as onchain JSON structures. 

When it comes to creating products and services to empower individuals and families to gain an income, I think it makes more sense (and credibility) for any and all proof to be onchain inside of an HCS message, and timestamped based on the consensus.

In addition wIth such a restriction I am concerned that it will limit the possible innovation for the development of new specs and processes for HIPs centred around HCS.

So I'd be more comfortable with a range of 8196 - 16392 bytes, with increased fees if required, anyone agree?

2) not sure what you mean by this question tbh, but if you get the message at sequence number 12 for example it will always be sequence number 12 if that is what you were asking.
3) hash-hash.info and app.dragonglass.me use their own custom logic, however most of the other mirror nodes are using the the record files that get pushed to AWS and GCP. Total delay between submission and mirror node discovery is the time for the message to reach consensus + record files to be published + ingestion from cloud files and writing to the DB. Record files now seem to be published every 2 seconds (used to be 5 iirc), so the whole process should take <10 seconds end to end
4) The most reliable way would be to host your own mirror node and exclude any irrelevant information. All of the mirrors appear to be consistent and all of them have the full history so far afaik.

I'm confused with the data from dragonglass, you can inspect the transaction within DG and see the valid start date of a transaction (in the transaction id) and the conensus timestamp.

Note that SDKs often shave a few seconds off the valid start time (e.g. 10:00:55 when it is 10:01:00) to allow for minor time drift between clients and nodes.

Also, it takes 5-8s to propagate a tx from mainnet to mirror nodes + mirror processing, so latency seen from a mirror will always be 5-10s even though the actual transaction took 3-5s to reach consensus.

See if you can compare the same transaction on other mirrors, just in case DG is calculating timestamps differently.","",""

Now, the mirror could give you the correct running hash and an incorrect message, so you'd have to verify the running hash yourself with the message.

All node know to stop broadcasting events (containing transactions) when they calculate that a supermajority (more than 2/3) of the nodes know of the transaction (they can calculate this because gossip about gossip tells them exactly who in the network knows of which events).

The problem with smart contracts imo is greater than this, they consume huge amount of resources since they are computed on every single node in the network. If there are 100 nodes, your contract function is run 100 times... When you start thinking about scaling to large numbers of transactions per second, the size of nodes required to handle this becomes totally unmanageable (1% of all cloud workloads in smart contracts on a 100 node network would mean the network as a whole being as big as ""The cloud"", think of the size of Microsoft + Google + Amazon cloud put together to give you a sense of the scale).

Besides node size, it would result in centralisation (nodes would be datacenters) and likely very high fees for transactions (whatever you pay a cloud provider today * 100 at least).

Blockchain talks about a trilemma, for my money, it's a four legged animal, on ledger execution of contracts is the fourth. I love smart contracts in principle, but the implementation in the real world (at scale) is a tough one.

Hedera proposes an alternative to lessen the burden on the network via HCS which hopefully will address the majority of requirements of creating trust in distributed computing, simply asking everyone to run everything isn't the answer.

They will work while we, as an industry, are experimenting, but for DeFi to reach every corner of the world (for example)... we'll need something better.","",""

Whoever can map multiple ""Real World"" identities and roll those all up into a nice Hedera Public key (Like an api gateway for users or something) will have a winning product.","","üöÄ (1)"

Currently the businesses each exist as messages on a topic.  To verify that the businesses are legit I was thinking of using scheduled transactions to have multiple accounts sign the transaction before it gets executed and recorded onto the topic.  FOr example I want to add an entry for Bob's Auto Garage.  Using a scheduled transaction, I could say don't record the transaction until Bob verifies the info .  Does this make sense?

A client of your node would submit a transaction, your node would submit the transaction to Hedera over HCS and all the other nodes would receive the message by subscribing to the topic (as would your node).
When the message is received by a node, it processes it into state (e.g. execute contract, etc...). At any given timestamp, all the nodes' state should be identical.

Blocks of transactions could also be deterministically generated by the nodes by bundling every n transactions into a block, or create a block every n seconds (as determined by the consensus timestamp of HCS messages).","",""

That's the same for all public ledgers.

Even if the SC 2.0 service can service hundreds of transactions per second (let's say 100 for this example), if 100 people send 1 tx per second, that's the SC2.0 service maxed out (Hedera is no different to others here).

So, if your use case needs 20 tps constantly, you could run your SC off chain (in your own private/permissioned/public network of smart contract nodes) and use HCS to ensure all your nodes are in sync and benefit from public consensus. HCS supports thousands of TPS, so your 20 would barely scratch the surface and the operational costs of your network + HCS may be lower than executing smart contracts (and you have the flexibility to use languages other than solidity, privacy possibly, etc...).

Hashing is not encrypting, it's lossy ""compression"" in that you can't recover the original data from a hash, only verify that some data does hash back to the same value.","",""

What do you mean by spinning validators programmatically ? One thought I had was to implement a topic message (maybe a separate topic) to advertise yourself as a validator, and have a UI where someone could create an auction and select which validators they would like to participate in the auction. That auction creation message would be posted to a HCS topic and include the list of validators for that particular auction. This means an auction system could have tens of validators and each auction be operated/managed by a subset (or all) of the validators. But this code doesn't exist today.

The advantage of the L2 solution is potentially cost and throughput (at scale), it could work with smart contracts of course with lower limits on scalability.","","üôå (2)"

A call out to all those smarter than me / familiar with code level mechanicals of how the Hashgraph consensus algorithm works:

I have watched many explanations (this is one of the better ones - https://youtu.be/Z6mn_VYhXSI).

What I don't fully understand is when each node is exchanging information, what information is actually exchanged and what are the actual operations completed during this exchange? 

Only passing over transaction information each node doesn't already know in their ledger is most efficient (most common explanation of what is happening with information associated in the precedent event cryptographic hash).

My questions with this is as follows:
1) How does each node knows what the other doesn't? Logically each node would have to send their entire ledger to each other each time to check this? As the ledger and network grows this would cause latency issues. However this is never discussed as a concern or even a potential possibility (most stating that scalability of the network is not an issues either with increased nodes and or ledger size). Is there some quick low bandwidth way to do this that is just assumed knowledge that I don't understand? I suppose you could only send x number of rounds of the ledger history based on x node size of the network, but that only delays the above issues. Any deeper understnading of what happens with node information exchange would be greatly appreciated (even seeing some code would be great).  
2) Also if a node starts sending modified transactions in their version of their historic hashgraph to other nodes, can a cryptographic hash of each transaction be enough to prove that transaction is real or fake or is there an issue if you have a malicious node acting in this way?

From what you have said, each node would need to check each others history of the Hashgraph ledger only back to 2-3 min of transactions. Is that what happens in practice?

When you submit transactions to a node, it puts them into a very (very) short queue and puts them into the next event it creates and gossips. Consensus timestamp is allocated to each transaction based on its order within the event.
Note: if you suspect a node is not putting your transaction in the next event, in the wrong order or in any event at all, you can choose to send your transaction to another node, or to two or more nodes. Any duplicate transactions will be de-duped at consensus and only the first to reach consensus will affect state, others will be marked as DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION. A small additional fee is paid for each of those duplicates (for the node to receive and process + gossip + consensus).","",""
"763413788958654474","Rompompom#0329","02/02/2022 10:00 AM","I'm trying to figure out racing conditions. Event (and therefore transaction) consensus timestamp is derived from some of the node's clocks. Clocks can be inaccurate within some tolerance.
Imagine the network is under heavy load, with few nodes and they collude. They adjust their clocks the maximum allowed time forward. An event gets a consensus timestamp of ""100000"". Colluding nodes adjust their clocks maximum allowed time backwards. Is there a reason the next event can't get timestamped ""99999""?
This will not alter the event (and transaction) order, as what is included is final. The sequence numbers will be correctly increased. But the timestamps will not go only up.
Something like this (for a given topic):
message1 sequence_number=1 consensus_timestamp=100000
message2 sequence_number=2 consensus_timestamp=99999
This is important when polling the rest api for new messages in a topic. I believe the safe way to do it is using the sequence number instead of consensus timestamp. Like ""get messages where sequence_number > last_seen.sequence_number"" instead of ""get messages where consensus_timestamp > last_seen.consensus_timestamp"".
Is there a hard rule in the code that would refuse to include a consensus_timestamp that's past what's already included?","",""

- As stated in the documentation, the limit for the topic memo is 100 bytes. As you point out, there are other places where the limit may be 100 characters, and those are correctly listed as well. 

- To the best of my knowledge, the renewal fees for consensus topics haven't been determined yet. Rent on Hedera will be introduced first for smart contracts, then it will be introduced for other entities (like consensus topics, accounts, tokens, etc.). 

- For the mirror node question, what @Supremax67is correct. Hedera operates a mirror node that provides free queries for testing that are throttled at 100 requests per second. For production applications, we suggest looking into mirror nodes operated by the community members - so options like DragonGlass and Kabuto.

2. Use other Private - permissioned blockchain and store hash on Hedera mirror node via HCS.

2. If we store some PII on-chain , how the access control is maintained. we need only few account can see the data not everyone on mirror node.

1. You can spin up a Hedera local node following this tutorial https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-local-node but it's more for the development.

2. Both options you mentioned above are valid. I would also suggest another option where you only store the raw data off-chain and then only hashes of the data in HCS. Private blockchain is not needed but you probably need to find a way to share data among members.

There are thus two `ResponseCodeEnum` values inside a `TransactionGetReceiptResponse`:
One in the `ResponseHeader` (named `nodeTransactionPrecheckCode`); and,
One in the `TransactionReceipt` (named status)

Now, the default value of ResponseCodeEnum is OK
so if the node doesn't set a value in the `TransactionGetReceiptResponse`, and you are using a client SDK like Java, then you will see OK for any ResponseCodeEnum field (edited) 
Furthermore, in this query response, if `nodeTransactionPrecheckCode != OK`, then the node does not set the status field at all
So here is what is (almost certainly) happening:
You are using the Golang SDK; and,
You are querying for a receipt the node can't find (so that `nodeTransactionPrecheckCode == RECEIPT_NOT_FOUND`); and,
You aren't testing whether `nodeTransactionPrecheckCode == OK`; and,
You are therefore getting the default ResponseCodeEnum value for status---since the node isn't actually setting this field

So I suggest you to first check whether the `nodeTransactionPrecheckCode` in the `ResponseHeader` is OK
if that value is not OK (but instead BUSY or RECEIPT_NOT_FOUND,  for example), then the status field in the receipt is meaningless. If `nodeTransactionPrecheckCode = OK,` then you now have to keep querying until you get the status SUCCESS
It's very unfortunate that we created the `ResponseCodeEnum` with default value`OK` but it can't be fixed now.","",""

(7) The 90 remaining users do something depending on wether the message is received or not until the next round starts
(8) Next round: Start again from step (4)

With the current implementation of scheduled transactions, the ConsensusSubmitMessage would immediately be posted (since the HCS topic has no SubmitKey set).

"429323958592995328","Greg Scullard#5365","12/09/2022 1:40 PM","Technically, the time to finality isn't quite `consensus_timestamp minus the transaction timestamp`, the transaction timestamp (valid_start) is determined by the SDK and is typically anything between 5 and 13s before your computer's time to ensure that when the tx reaches a node, it's not rejected for being too early (valid_start > node time) which was a thing in the past and was annoying...

So if you take this value (which could be as much as 2 minutes if you wanted to), you're not getting a true latency figure.

Create to consensus (or latency) is from the moment an event is created in Hashgraph containing your transaction and the moment the transaction reaches consensus (which should always be less that consensus_timestamp - transaction timestamp).

You can see the c2c time here, but it's not reported on a per-transaction basis by the APIs or mirror nodes: https://app.metrika.co/dashboard/hedera/network-overview?tr=1d

The nearest approximation would be to snapshot your computer's clock time and deduct from the consensus time, it would remain an approximation.","","üëç (1)"
"429323958592995328","Greg Scullard#5365","12/09/2022 1:46 PM","It's a Hedera service which gives you access to the ""raw"" Hashgraph consensus via an API.
Instead of sending a fully qualified transaction to the network such as a CryptoTransfer, you're able to send an arbitrary message to Hedera inside a `ConsensusSubmitTransaction`. Hedera doesn't try to interpret the message, it merely takes the transaction to consensus and gives it a fair and unique timestamp.
The transaction is echoed on mirror nodes where you can subscribe to a ""topicId"" to which you sent your message and get all the messages sent to that topic in consensus order, with a sequence number, fair timestamp and running hash to enable anyone to verify the validity of a message sequence.

You can think of the consensus service as ""A decentralised message queue"", ""a tamper-proof message chain"".

The messages inside the `ConsensusSubmitTransaction` can be anything you want (up to 1K bytes), encrypted or not, json, plain text...

Since I still need at least a good estimate of the c2c time for my transaction, I guess I will start a timer right after sending the transaction to the network and measure the seconds that pass until the message is available on the subscribed consensus topic.

So what I'm gathering is that if you are a client that needs to be inherently suspicious of what information is being returned to you by the mirror network (where the distrust is originating based on the Use Case requiring a very high degree of proof/accuracy/verifiability/etc.)

that you would have basically two options:

1. Operate your own internal mirror node, which would automatically and computationally verify all information coming to it from the consensus nodes, because this is just what mirror nodes are built to do. This would be the strongest guarantee.

or

2. Ask the same question of multiple independent mirror nodes. If you get the same answer from multiple, you could have higher trust in the response than if you just asked one.","","üëç (1)"

All such messages are push (rather than pull). Each shard (its members) maintains a queue of outgoing
messages to each of the other shards. Each shard remembers the sequence number of the last message
it processed from each of the other shards. A message is sent from shard Alpha to shard Beta by nodes
in Alpha randomly contacting nodes in Beta, to transfer the message, along with a proof that it is part of
the consensus state of the Alpha shard. They continue doing this until one of the Beta members replies
with a proof that the Beta shard shared state includes a sequence number indicating that this message
was received and processed. In this manner, transactions that impact addresses in different shards can
be appropriately recorded into each shards state, and so the entire state of the entire ledger.""`

It is a common pattern for a solidity method to use a modifier to in effect replicate 'scheduling' - i.e. a user touches any method and they pay for the gas to update the rest of it. Any external pieces can be centralized or decentralized (through time?) but you leave business logic protected in a Smart Contract to add rigour. I think there are some sensible pay offs that get you much of the way to where you might want to be (that would be preferable to handing over keys - although that's an option if users were comfortable **not advocating this at all but web3=choice**)","",""
"773104286896619541","reg.cs#2829","01/27/2023 12:11 PM","For the payment part between buyer and seller, I can easily imagine a smart contract escrow with a deposit/withdrawal mechanism. However, for the bidding part a SC is not ideal. Partially due to price, partially due to the polling issue. A HCS topic would be better for the bidding. The best scheme I can come up with is:
- a user has its actual funds in a dedicated wallet app which they register with a smart contract for fund withdrawal/deposit (that way the dapp has no private key for the user funds)
- dApp creates a separate Hedera account for the user upon registration which handles the automated calls like bidding

The dapp then would handle only the private key for the second account, which at least increases security. The remaining issue is, that the second account would still need enough HBAR to pay for the bidding process and other transactions. It would be nice if the user could set up an allowance for the second account to pay all transaction fees for the second account from the users primary account (in the best case: The user could define in the allowance exactly which topics and smart contracts they allow spending for) . But that seems to be impossible, right? 

If so, the user would need to transfer some hbar to the second account every few days leaving the risk for the dapp beeing hacked and the money allocated for the fees of the automated calls to be stolen. I think this scheme is good, except for the latter part. And I am trying to resolve this without sacrificing any of the decentralization.","",""
