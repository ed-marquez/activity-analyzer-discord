How to setGas() in smart contract functions? What amount should be set for proper functioning of smart contract queries?",,
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,11/22/2021 5:30 AM,"There is no way to calculate the gas cost of executing a smart contract without actually executing it (which costs gas ;). Reason being that the execution could depend on a number of factors affecting the number of CPU cycles or memory used during the execution. Think of it as if you're putting gas in your car to go somewhere. If nobody's telling you where (or even how far) you're going how can you estimate how much gas to put in the tank.

Suggest you increase the gas incrementally until it works (if your function's execution costs vary over time, you may need to increase that gas too).
Also try to increase the maxQueryFee and/or maxTransaction fee on your operation.",,

So the challenge with any royalty is that two people are involved in the operation, the token holder (Alice) sending the token to someone (Bob) who's paying Alice for the token and also paying the token issuer (Carol) a royalty.
It is necessary for both Alice and Bob to sign the transaction, Alice to approve the transfer of the token to Bob and Bob to approve the payment to Alice + Carol.
Whether this is done natively with the token service or a smart contract doesn't change the fact that both parties need to approve the operation.

In a P2P scenario it's challenging... we need support from wallets for scheduled transactions or the ability to notify someone of a transaction they need to sign.

Marketplaces help to some extent, but not entirely since you need to transfer ""ownership"" of your token to a marketplace so that they can sell it on your behalf (they can better manage the signature collection process), however, in transferring the token to the marketplace, you're back to the P2P scenario in that the simple act of transferring the token to the marketplace (in escrow) incurs a royalty payment. This is particularly important if the royalty payment has a fixed component, even transferring the token to the marketplace for free would result in the fixed royalty being paid to the issuer...

We should create a HIP to add support for an allowance feature called Approve on HTS meaning you can ""share"" control of the token with someone else (and as the owner, revoke that control). The someone else (a marketplace) would then be able to sell the token on your behalf, but it would never have been transferred to them in the first place, just granted the ability to transfer it on your behalf.",,üëç (1)

1.40596E+17,Rocket#2012,12/07/2021 11:21 AM,@Greg Scullard sharing control is an interesting idea. I've been mulling over how to implement a subscription service where a user is debited monthly but retains ownership of their token/hbar,,
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,12/08/2021 8:42 AM,"@Rocket the notion of sharing is somewhat different I think. It means that I can delegate the authority to someone else to transfer my token, while retaining the ability to revert that authorisation should I want to.
In the context of a fungible token, it means allowing another account to sign a transaction to transfer up to n tokens (or several transactions totalling n tokens or less).
In the context of a non fungible token, it's the same except the quantity is 1.

I guess in your context, this could be implemented with a smart contract that has approval to debit your token balance by a determined amount at a given frequency, you'd allow the contract to spend and therefore renew the subscription every so often. If the allowance is insufficient, the subscription would lapse. If you no longer wanted the subscription (and had left over allowed balance in the contract), you'd revoke the allowance.",,
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,12/08/2021 8:43 AM,"(Assuming the token service supported allowances, otherwise you'd have to do it all in-contract, ERC-20 and ERC-721 implement these allowances).",,

8.97267E+17,johnsonb-oci#6673,12/10/2021 11:44 AM,"No, at least not with using HTS. There has been talk recently about adding a hip to add the erc-20 approve action, which would allow the DEX to transfer W tokens of XYZ on your behalf, then one could have the order book logic for a contract do the approve, when party1 of the trade does its limit sell/buy, and when party2 comes in to complete the other end of the trade with PDQ tokens, all they need to do is send a transaction to the smart contract with its (party2) signature.

We had proposed Hedera to our client (not knowing these limitations, last time I tried hedera in june 2020, when the same contract was working fine at that time) but now facing these issues, either needs to tell client the Truth or need to compromise on smart contract functionality.

With regards signatures, it will depend on your transaction and account setup.
1. The simplest is Bob pays for a transaction to transfer 10h from his account to Alice's account. Only Bob needs to sign
2. Carol pays for a transaction to transfer 10h from Bob's account to Alices, both Carol and Bob need to sign (Carol to approve the payment for the transaction, Bob to approve the 10h debit from his account)
3. Bob and Carol have a joint account setup with multi-sig such that both need to approve a transaction. They pay for a transaction to transfer 10h from this joint account to Alice, both Bob and Carol need to sign in order to approve the transaction.

When Hedera nodes receive the transaction, they verify the signature against the public keys of the accounts/entities for which the transaction needs approval and if all the signatures are present and match the public keys, the nodes deem the transaction valid from an authorisation point of view.

The only thing left then is fetching the timestamp for when they received the NFT in order to calculate the rewards. Not sure if that can be done so easily.",,

8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,01/27/2022 11:37 AM,"@johnsonb-oci couple of options here:

1) You can use ethers.js or web3.js with the Hedera SDKs to parse event logs, either from transaction records or mirror node api results. So, to get event data in a readable fashion you would use the contract‚Äôs ABI, log data, and ethers/web.js.
Here's some sample JS code using ethers.js and mirror node (can do something similar with info from the tx record):

> async function getEventsFromMirror(contractId) {
>     const url = `https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/contracts/${contractId.toString()}/results/logs?order=asc`;
> 
>     axios.get(url)
>         .then(function (response) {
>             const jsonResponse = response.data;
> 
>             jsonResponse.logs.forEach(log => {
>                 // create an object to specify log parsing requirements
>                 let logRequest = {};
>                 logRequest.data = log.data;
>                 logRequest.topics = log.topics;
>                 // parse the logs
>                 let event = abiInterface.parseLog(logRequest);
>                 // output the from address and message stored in the event
>                 console.log(`Mirror event(s): from '${AccountId.fromSolidityAddress(event.args.from).toString()}' update to '${event.args.message}'`);
>             });
>         })
>         .catch(function (err) {
>             console.error(err);
>         });
> }


2) Get the logs and events directly from a mirror node (https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-226 and https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-227) and use your own library, if applicable. Probably the first option makes more sense for most folks.

@bugbytes the problem with contracts is that they're a ""how long is a piece of string"" problem. The state of the contract, how much the code writes to the state, how many CPU cycles, memory the call will use isn't deterministic (unless the contract doesn't make any changes which wouldn't be very useful).

As for variable contract fees, that is also approaching a grey line of fairness. Smart contracts on any network could  bottleneck during peak times due to the way smart contracts operates. I wouldn't be surprised after SC 2.0 that many still sticks to HCS for their day to day solutions.",,

8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,02/04/2022 3:51 PM,"Hey @AlKlim, All Hedera **transactions **and most **queries **have a small fee associated with them because they all consume resources from network nodes. 
When you work with smart contracts, you also have to think about gas because that's how the EVM computational resources are paid for. 

The gas part for the ContractCall is taken care of with .setGas(). 
The max query payment is an optional parameter that you specify only if you want to limit how much you spend in query fees. You can do the same for transaction fees. 

In this case, it's using the full amount that you specify for the query because you're using:
`Query.setQueryPayment()`
This sets an **explicit **payment amount for this query. The client will submit exactly this amount for the payment of this query. Hedera will not return any remainder.

Instead, you may want to use: 
`.setMaxQueryPayment()`
This sets the **maximum **payment allowable for queries.
You can use this method for individual requests or at the client level with *client.setMaxQueryPayment* (which applies the limits for all queries done by the client)",,

Not that I'm aware of. @Greg Scullard can help confirm. 
On Hedera all transactions and most queries require a small payment because they still consume resources from a network node (even if not changing state). Other networks may make viewing free to offset tx fees that are 100s of dollars.

2.49977E+17,intense#3332,02/15/2022 10:18 AM,"Hello,

There is a bug with the HTS Precompiled which I would believe you are aware of. I believe it might also be related to Issue #64 (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/64) from Hedera Services repo. 

Not giving enough gas to the transaction which calls the HTS Precompiled, you would expect to receive a 30 status code - `INSUFFICIENT_GAS`, instead you will receive a status 21 - `UNKNOWN` inside the smart contract.

The issue can be found at `HederaMessageCallProcessor` lines 82-89 (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/be01b229480f22fc4b7c606a8ba61c19243ba1b8/hedera-node/src/main/java/com/hedera/services/contracts/execution/HederaMessageCallProcessor.java#L82):

```
final Bytes output = contract.compute(frame.getInputData(), frame);
final Gas gasRequirement = contract.gasRequirement(frame.getInputData());
operationTracer.tracePrecompileCall(frame, gasRequirement, output);
if (frame.getRemainingGas().compareTo(gasRequirement) < 0) {
    frame.decrementRemainingGas(frame.getRemainingGas());
    frame.setExceptionalHaltReason(Optional.of(INSUFFICIENT_GAS));
    frame.setState(EXCEPTIONAL_HALT);
}
```

Although the output returns success, the statement afterwards would make the execution halt with insufficient gas. We might also argue why would we do the computation if there wasn‚Äôt enough gas for it in the first place but I believe the issue relates to how Besu treats the frame state. Setting the state to `EXCEPTIONAL_HALT` means that the state would be cleared, along with gas and output data so this means we will not get the necessary response code even if the output would return it.

This issue creates a bit of discomfort considering that there are 280 response codes (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/d2897a447d3a6dd68ae170b77180fbb5467725a6/src/main/proto/response_code.proto#L31) and `UNKNOWN` is received.",,üôè (1)
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,02/15/2022 10:25 AM,Unknown could be the SDK not being up to date with the latest response codes and not being able to evaluate the actual response code returned by Hedera.,,

We are waiting on some HIPs (hedera improvement proposals) which have yet to launch on the network. Smart Contracts 2.0 is launching somewhat in stages, the ability for interoperability with HTS (Hedera token service) is already live etc. HIP 218 (Smart Contract interactions with Hedera Token Accounts) and create2 have yet to launch. Those are need for our project, as such the statement by Nari which you were looking to verify as false is accurate. 

The HIPs are not yet launched on mainnet or testnet, so your statement about the testnet and mainnet being 'basically' the same is accurate, we can't test on either.

Because of https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/hedera-api/smart-contracts/contractupdate , `So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed.`, I thought I can change bytecode if I set AdminKey when creating new smart contract.
I tried to use https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/smart-contracts/update-a-smart-contract , the `setBytecodeFileId` method, but the bytecode was not changed.
I'm confused.. Is updating bytecode feature deprecated? or not made yet? Or do I misunderstand about this feature?",,

You don't cover the cost, the ledger will inevitably suffer, as already seen on ledgers that has been around for a couple of years. 

Most devs entering the crypto space might see this as being an issue until they keep using the same ""no expiry"" ledgers over the course of 2+ years.

- If that doesn't work, It's possible that it could be an issue with the SDK. Btw, which version of the SDK are you using?

- v0.24 went live on the Testnet  yesterday and it introduces a **new level of interoperability with native Hedera Token Service (HTS) tokens via HIP-218**
- Basically, the Hedera EVM now exposes HTS fungible tokens as an ERC-20 and HTS non-fungible token as ERC-721
- That means you can do some token operations directly from a contract (like lookup token name, symbol, etc)

Resources
- v0.24 release notes: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/release-notes/services#v0.24
- Docs for supported operations: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/smart-contracts/supported-erc-token-standards

**Here's a simplified example.** 
If you deploy this contract (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/master/test-clients/src/main/resource/contract/solidity/ERC20Contract.sol) and create an HTS fungible token, then you can call any of those contract functions with some code like: 

`    // Execute HIP-218 functions using ContractExecuteTransaction()
    const contractExecTx = new ContractExecuteTransaction()
        .setContractId(contractId)
        .setGas(3000000)
        .setFunction(""name"", new ContractFunctionParameters().addAddress(tokenAddressSol));
    const contractExecSubmit = await contractExecTx.execute(client);
    const contractExecRec = await contractExecSubmit.getRecord(client);

    const txRec = await new TransactionRecordQuery()
        .setTransactionId(contractExecRec.transactionId)
        .setIncludeChildren(true)
        .execute(client);

Or you can also do the association and transfer with a single function, like: 

   ` function tokenAssoTrans(int64 _amount) external {        
        int response1 = HederaTokenService.associateToken(address(this), tokenAddress);
    
        int response2 = HederaTokenService.transferToken(tokenAddress, msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

Check if your contract has an admin key. If it does, that key may need to sign the association. If it doesn't it should work.

8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,04/04/2022 2:41 PM,"@littletarzan @Bart, @bugbytes , @Matt Smithies @johnda98, you folks are active in this channel, so here's a rough repo (https://github.com/ed-marquez/quick-contract-examples) with  a few smart contract examples. This repo will be cleaned up and referenced somewhere in docs at some point...

It has examples like:
- transferring HTS tokens to contracts (explicitely with addresses or via keywords like ***msg*** and ***this***)
- transferring HBAR to contracts (via fallback function or with .setPayableAmount)
- working hip-218
- setting a contract as **treasury accnt**, **supply key** for a token, etc
 (The goal is just to show some of the mechanics)

@johnda98 , to your point, example 7 shows how to have an **immutable contract** be the **treasury **and **supply key** for **immutable HTS token** and how to have that contract mint directly to a user while receiving payments in HBAR. Contracts atm can't create tokens or be the adminKey for a token, but that will be coming soon. And the current operations, will get easier too as we iron out kinks...

@Si Chen glad to hear it worked! Hopefully some of those examples are helpful",,‚ù§Ô∏è (5)
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,04/04/2022 2:45 PM,Ed..  by chance did you ever get to testing a working payable fallback func ? see if a third party wallet can send hbar to contractID that has that working fallback. and prove deposit by calling public  of the balance or msg.vale and seeing if the msg.sender shows the sending account(in .sol format of course).   I would hazard a guess that INVALID AccountID or similar still gets thrown on the wallet send..   nature of the crypto send protocol..etc.    bit busy here.,,
8.87864E+17,littletarzan#5253,04/04/2022 2:46 PM,I've done it with fallback() and receive(),,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,04/04/2022 2:47 PM,@littletarzan cool.. did you send from another wallet ? or a internal/ call?.    and msg.sender had the sending account in .sol ?  nice,,
8.87864E+17,littletarzan#5253,04/04/2022 2:47 PM,"both where smart contract function calls... fallback was using a function name that does not exist in the contract, receive was for undefined function name",,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,04/04/2022 2:48 PM,arh...  so you didnt send hbar to a contractid via a 3rd part wallet.. ie a regular crypto send.,,

7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,04/04/2022 2:51 PM,I think protocol still dissallows that.. could be wrong.. need to ask the Hedera EVM/crypto send deeper stack guys.   last time I tried it was 2 yrs ago.. and the HBAR dissapeared.. ie the xfer occured but didnt show in the contract balance ... then shortly after in later versions I got a INVALID AccountID exception..  soooo not available..  moved on at that point.  only now with 100% DeFi will I need to re-visit this in the weeks ahead...  it maybe a restricted action - to maintain TPS rate or something.  thats fine..  just means a 3rd party wallet cannot just send HBAR to a contract ID.,,

For example 100 such transfers.  Since 100 exceeds the Hedera limit for how many accounts can be affected by a single transaction (10 as per the docs) I am forced to update these accounts by issuing transactions in sets of 10.

I am pretty sure that if I have a problem between my 5th and 6th  (of 10) multi transfer call and abort (revert) the smart contract there will be no change of state in the Hashgraph - i.e.; that Smart Contracts are ATOMIC.  However, I am more interested in what happens when the Smart Contract is invoked by multiple clients (each wanting to cause 100 arbitrary transfers) at the same time.  My question is whether or not the Smart Contract allows multiple clients to call it at the same time, or whether it will automatically serialize these calls to one at a time.

I deployed a payable fallback test SC .. with the  'receive()' function .. solidity 0.8.. latest..  says its executed on a plain ETH transfer(just like a payable fallback but 'safer').. and in this case.. HBAR xfer of course... sooooo.. I sent 800HBAR to 0.0.34144222 as a destination accnt in a basic wallet HBAR xfer crypto call..   cool !  no exceptions to a Invalid Account by the wallet send.. and the transaction sees to go baby! and the 800HBAR gets deducted from the sending account....   BUT... when I called the Contract to get the public getters that are set to msg.sender, msg.value and address(this).balance in the receive() external payable function.. their values were 0 and msg.sender also null.    So this HBAR went somewhere   https://testnet.dragonglass.me/transactions/00260865721649373815357500467",,

In this case, you could use a `.getUintX` variant ( https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/blob/main/src/contract/ContractFunctionResult.js#L183 ). If you return a tuple, you pass in an index of the element you want out ... otherwise, if you return a single `uint` you can call it without any index like so: `.getUintX()`.

8.97786E+17,vic.a#4499,04/14/2022 7:12 AM,to obtain a `ContractFunctionResult` you need to either do a `ContractCallQuery` (example: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/create-simple-contract.js#L76 ) if the method you are calling is non-mutating (eg. `view`) or do a `ContractExecuteTransaction` ( https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/create-stateful-contract.js#L116 ) followed by a `TransactionRecordQuery` on the resulting `TransactionResponse` object if the method you are calling is mutating the contract's state.,,‚ÑπÔ∏è (1)

So, lets say me, you and leemon wanna start a dao for a new startup because we dont trust eachover, we all agree and create a smart contract that can be called to publish our votes to a private topic (our dao). The SC could also have functionality to check that the acc that called a vote does infact hold the nft/token that gives the account rights to vote without the need for a third party?, the SC will need a way to directly query the network, instead of relying on receiving verification calls that are processed off-network (servers that listen to contract events).

Debugging contract revert errors can be tricky. The best way I found with the SDK is to query the mirror node for the tx ID from the execution object. For example:

    const contractCallSubmit4 = await contractCallTx4.execute(client);

    acc = contractCallSubmit4.transactionId.accountId.num.toString();
    sec = contractCallSubmit4.transactionId.validStart.seconds.toString();

        `\n- https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/transactions/0.0.${acc}-${sec}-${nano}`

This is all works great.  Now I want to accomplish the same thing but from a smart contract using the precompiled HTS Smart Contract Integration.

In short I perform the following steps:
i) Create a File paid for by PAYOR
ii) Append my smart contract byte code to the file, paid for by PAYOR
iii) Create the Smart Contract with the following - paid for by PAYOR

fx.ContractParams = new CreateContractParams
        {
            File = fx.FileRecord.File, 
           Administrator = fx.PayorEndorsement,
            Signatory = fx.PayorSignatory,
        };
        fx.ContractRecord = await fx.Client.CreateContractWithRecordAsync(fx.ContractParams);

iv)  Call the Smart Contract - paid for by PAYOR and signed by TREASURY:

var record = await fx.Client.CallContractWithRecordAsync(new CallContractParams
            {
                ...
                Contract = fx.ContractRecord.Contract,
                Signatory =  Payor,
            }, ctx =>
                ctx.Signatory = TREASURY

However, this fails with invalid signature.   I have tried switching the above signatories around, signing with both the PAYOR and TREASURY keys in either/both places, etc.,  but I get the same result.  The ONLY time it works is if PAYOR = TREASURY.  How can I call a contract that uses HTS Integration Services but have it paid for by an account that is not the TREASURY account?",,

- `.getUintXX()` or similar method returned as part of a `ContractCallQuery` execution object.

8.02388E+17,RodDaSilva#3988,04/28/2022 8:43 PM,"@Ed Marquez - thanks for detailing these.  Looks like I will need to call TransactionRecordQuery() immediately after ContractExecuteTransaction(). However, I am still not clear whether my app should have retry loop logic  calling TransactionRecordQuery() in the event the result is delayed ,or whether that is built into the call?  I am curious why these two calls - intended to be called one after the other - are split.  Is there a technical reason ContractExecuteTransaction() can't return the result itself? It returns a transaction receipt indicating I believe that Hedera has reached consensus on the smart contract execution so technically wouldn't it know the result?",,
8.02388E+17,RodDaSilva#3988,04/28/2022 8:49 PM,"SEPARATE QUESTION:

As above I have a smart contract that transfers tokens from a Treasury account to one or more recipient accounts that I would like to be callable (i.e; paid for) by two separate accounts - payor and alternatePayor.  But I can't seem to get this to work.  

In short I perform the following steps:
i) Create a File paid for by PAYOR
ii) Append my smart contract byte code to the file, paid for by PAYOR
iii) Create the Smart Contract with the following - with the two signatories:

fx.ContractParams = new CreateContractParams
        {
            File = fx.FileRecord.File, 
           Administrator = fx.PayorEndorsement,
            Signatory = **new Signatory( fx.PayorSignatory, fx.AlternatePayorSignatory)**
        };
        fx.ContractRecord = await fx.Client.CreateContractWithRecordAsync(fx.ContractParams);

iv)  Call the Smart Contract - paid for by PAYOR and signed by TREASURY:

var record = await fx.Client.CallContractWithRecordAsync(new CallContractParams
            {
                ...
                Contract = fx.ContractRecord.Contract,
                Signatory =  **Payor**,
            }, ctx =>
                ctx.Signatory = **new Signatory(TreasurySignatory, PayorSignatory);**
                ctx.SignaturePrefixTrimLimit = int.MaxValue;
 )

The above works in that the smart contract call is paid for by Payor.  However if I alternatively try to call the contract with the alternatePayor as below it fails with InvalidSignature:


var record = await fx.Client.CallContractWithRecordAsync(new CallContractParams
            {
                ...
                Contract = fx.ContractRecord.Contract,
                Signatory =  **alternatePayor**,
            }, ctx =>
                ctx.Signatory = **new Signatory(TreasurySignatory, AlternatePayorSignatory);**
                ctx.SignaturePrefixTrimLimit = int.MaxValue;
  )

How can I create a contract that can be called with either payor?",,

In the case where you call `**WithRecordAsync`, the `ctx=>ctx.Payer` also pays for retrieving the record (in other words Payer signs two transactions), typically you match `ctx=>ctx.Signatory` only with the Payer account, particularly because it it not necessary for the other parties involved in the transaction to sign the query to get the record.  If you have other parties that must sign a transaction, you typically use the `Signatory` on the `***Params` object itself, this is seen as the ""extra"" signers.

8.02388E+17,RodDaSilva#3988,04/29/2022 1:19 PM,"@bugbytes  Rocks!  That helped me to get the payor/alternatePayor scenario working.   As you suggested the **WithRecordAsync()** call fails with the alternatePayor but only in the retrieving of the Transaction Record.   The actual smart contract call was paid with the alternatePayor.  I will get around that by not using the **WithRecordAsync()** version and create and sign a separate call to fetch the transaction record myself.  To close the loop on this, and for the benefit of anyone else who needs to do similar below are the main parts of the solution:

// Contract Creation
fx.ContractParams = new CreateContractParams
        {
            File = fx.FileRecord.File, 
           Administrator = fx.PayorEndorsement,
        };
       await fx.Client.CreateContractWithRecordAsync(fx.ContractParams, ctx =>
            {
                ctx.Payer = fx.Payor;
                ctx.Signatory = fx.PayorSignatory;
            });

//Call the Smart Contract - paid for by PAYOR and signed by TREASURY:

var record = await fx.Client.CallContractWithRecordAsync(new CallContractParams
            {
                ...
                Contract = fx.ContractRecord.Contract,               
            }, ctx =>
               **ctx.Payer = PayorAddress;**
               ** ctx.Signatory = new Signatory(JurisdictionTreasurySignatory, PayorSignatory); )**

The above works in that the smart contract call is paid for by Payor.  Alternatively to call the contract paid for by the alternatePayoras below::

var record = await fx.Client.CallContractWithRecordAsync(new CallContractParams
            {
                ...
                Contract = fx.ContractRecord.Contract,
            }, ctx =>
                   **ctx.Payer = AlternatePayorAddress;**
               ** ctx.Signatory = new Signatory(JurisdictionTreasurySignatory, AlternatePayorSignatory); )**

The only way you can try and lower the risk of fraudulent stuff like this is to do your due diligence when signing a transaction. Usually, good dapps have their contract addresses listed somewhere (a lot of the times you would see them in a footer of a page). If the browser extension one matches the HTTPS-fenced dapp listed one, then there's a high chance (not perfect, of course) that you are signing the real thing. 

In an open, trustless, ecosystem vigilance should always remain key ESPECIALLY if actions are known to be cryptographically secured",,üíØ (1)

That way, they could trick the user into thinking they call the correct address!?

Because those functions dont trip msg.sender and msg.value wont show the hbar coming in.. but the address(this).balance obviously does show the hbar deposit.. but wont be able to send it back to the sender as no msg.sender.. unless your app monitors the Transactions to the contract for a crypto deposit.  Of course a ContractExecute call w hbar deposit is dandy fine.,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,05/06/2022 4:01 PM,@littletarzan I had to append my code to check just in case hbar came in from a mystery sender.. as the contract wouldnt know who..   I had it sent to the investor anyway.. as a bonus - I guess I could have the platform scrape it off if the balance is above a prev state stored balance... but then hey it wouldnt be a trusty cool contract if a platform could mess with depositors funds.. well for DeFi anyway.,,

When executing the function ""getMobileNumber"" with function parameter ""Alice"" and 10,000 gas (0.001 HBAR I believe) through my JS file, the contract works perfectly and returns the number 111111

However, when attempting to execute this function via my Blade wallet demo application (Github: https://github.com/Blade-Labs/wallet-demo), this fails due to insufficient gas.

I've taken a look at the function calls on this block explorer type service for Hedera --> https://testnet.dragonglass.me/hedera/contracts/0.0.34716571

And they do seem to be going through, just failing due to insufficient gas. This is the case even when increasing gas by 1000x. Why could this be happening? I need to be able to execute smart contract functions via a web wallet easily, but thus far I have run into quite a few issues",,

I like to think of asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance as the Sergio Leone of smart systems:

‚ÄúThe fact that hashgraph is asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT) means that as long as an attacker has less than 1/3 of the total stake, they will be unable to either stop consensus from proceeding, or cause an inconsistent consensus, or inappropriately skew the consensus order and consensus timestamps that hashgraph delivers. The more honest actors that commit their tokens as stake, the more secure the overall security of the network will be - as honest stake raises the bar for a malicious actor to be able to reach the 1/3 threshold.‚Äù

I'm guessing the HashConnect provides a signer or provider object which can then be used with Hedera SDK or Hethers to interact with smart contracts. I know I'm likely getting it wrong. Would really be nice if someone could explain the whole workflow to me and how to piece it all together with the goal being interacting with smart contracts from a Dapp.

I'm trying to understand how we can interact with USDC through Hedera. 

My goal is:
1. Use HTS to tokenize an asset like a financial receivable for a company
2. Take that token and lock it up as collateral to borrow USDC

It sounds like this involves creating some kind of liquidity pool contract for ""USDC <> [my_new_token]"" that is funded by USDC, then send my_new_token to that contract to lock it in and get back USDC.

Is that right?",,

Basically the gas refund is at most 20% of the gas limit (reservation) you specify. The goal there is to incentivize transaction submitters to get within 25% of the actual gas used in order to not be charged for the unused gas reservation. 

The `setQueryPayment` amount is used entirely because that's an explicit payment amount you're setting. You can alternatively specify a ceiling for the query payment with `.setMaxQueryPayment()` and the payment will go through for whichever amount necessary as long as its below the limit.

- Can I import OZ token templates or is there some kind of ERC20 interface from Hedera that I should import?

- Is there somewhere that I can find existing contract's source code so I can see what methods/functions they have? I specifically want to see the source code for USDC, but can't seem to find that on any of the explorers. In my sample contract I am using transferFrom as I assumed USDC's Hedera smart contract would have that. Now I am not sure hence why I want to see what functions it has, so I can figure out which function to call to transfer on behalf of another entity.

- I have tried deploying my contract but receive the following error status: CONTRACT_REVERT_EXECUTED. I've found the transaction on an explorer but still can't really tell why it's creation is being reverted. Would you have any idea or where I can find some more docs to look into this?

- My expected workflow was this: 
1) user approves contract for amount by calling approve function on token smart contract -> 
2) user calls setTransfer function on smart contract to move tokens into smart contract address -> 
3) user calls executeTransfer function on smart contract to move tokens from smart contract address to user address

If USDC on Hedera doesn't have approve and transferFrom then I guess my expected workflow won't work.

- You can create tokens on Hedera in three different ways:
-- With Hedera Token Service (HTS) using the SDKs, without writing a smart contract (see https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/tokens/define-a-token)
-- With HTS using a smart contract - you would have to use the **TokenCreate precompile** (see https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/smart-contracts/hedera-service-solidity-libraries)
-- ERC 20 contract - like @littletarzan said, this works fine, but keep in mind what the ecosystem supports

- My understanding is also that USDC is a native token on Hedera.

- This page (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/smart-contracts/supported-erc-token-standards) means that if you have an HTS token, you can interact with it as if it was an ERC token for the supported functions you see there. 
-- When we spoke about approve / allowance not being supported in that page, all that means is that you can't do those operations for HTS tokens as if they were ERC.
-- However, **you can do approve and allowance via the SDK**. See (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/cryptocurrency/approve-an-allowance). So you can authorize accounts or contracts to spend hbar and tokens on behalf of other accounts/contracts

hope that helps",,üëç (1)

Smart contract storage is virtually unlimited, correct? as In amount of information it can hold. lets say wallet addresses because of course it has to hold all wallets that purchased token SC mints. 
But does that mean SCs can return unlimited responses? As in, if I want to dump entire list of all token holders in SC, can I do it even with 7 billion wallets recorded? Or is there a cap in view function return size?",,

3.68134E+17,csthompson#9365,05/16/2022 4:27 PM,I believe the return size might be capped at 6kb. Returning this amount of data would never be recommended though in any DLT setting. What is the use case? Getting a list of all current holders?,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,05/16/2022 4:27 PM,np.. Leemon promised to send me a Pint of IPA and a bag of chips(crisps) for adding-value as Tech support when @Ed Marquez  is busy cooking the crisps..,,

USD$ index at highest in 5yrs+ in last couple of weeks..   Higher 'valued' USD = takes less Fiat $ for 1 HBAR.. ie    Humanoids confuse 'price' and 'value' all the time..  and always stupidly measure in Fiat currency because thats what they have done since they were 4yrs old.,,

Essentially a couple of oracles through couple of apis should inform Hedera network that Event A (mint/burn/transfer) occurred on Network X (ETH/Solana) and vice versa inform Network X that Event B occurred on Hedera. But it boils down to hitting different api than yours, same idea though.",,

7.73104E+17,reg.cs#2829,05/25/2022 2:38 AM,I currently have a general understanding issue: Imagine a smart contract that needs to hold 100 hbar and a NFT until a specific condition is fulfilled. Hbar and NFT are initially coming from two different accounts and will be given to these accounts (atomic swap) after the condition is fulfilled. How would the initial transfer (NFT and 100 hbar to the smart contract) take place? Would the smart contract initiate the transfer transaction and request the signing by the users or would each user create a transfer transaction to the smart contract? Is there a simple example for that anywhere?,,
7.73104E+17,reg.cs#2829,05/25/2022 2:48 AM,And also: Can a smart contract actually hold hbar and tokens or do you need to create a separate account for the smart contract that then holds the tokens/hbar for the smart contract?,,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,05/25/2022 4:20 AM,From my understanding each SC has account itself and this account is a storage and dump for mint occured in SC,,üëçüèª (1)
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,05/25/2022 4:24 AM,Each SC has an account (same id as the contract) which can receive hbar and tokens.,,
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,05/25/2022 4:29 AM,"A smart contract cannot initiate a transaction and request signing (it may be able to in the future when smart contract can created scheduled transactions).
In your example:
* The NFT seller might call the contract to indicate they're will to sell for 100, transferring the token to the contract and maybe includes a SaleId and time limit
* The buyer calls the contract, sending it hbar and specifying the SaleId they're interested in
* If the time limit isn't expired, the contract passes the 100h to the seller and the token to the buyer
* If the time limit is expired, the contract throws an error (optionally transfers the token back to the seller)
* If the token isn't transferred to the seller above, the seller can (after time x), claim it back from the contract by calling an appropriate method.",,
7.73104E+17,reg.cs#2829,05/25/2022 4:44 AM,"Ok, thank. The concept is clear now, but I am not sure how the function calls would be used correctly. Is it like that:
* The NFT seller execute a `ContractExecuteTransaction` specifying the SaleID, the price, and the time limit as parameters first and then call a simple `TransferTransaction` for the NFT with the ContractID as receiver?
* The buyer only call a `ContractExecuteTransaction` with the SaleID as parameter and use the `setPayableAmount()` set to 100 hbar?",,
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,05/25/2022 4:45 AM,"Contracts can invoke HTS token methods, so the seller could specify the token they want to transfer to the contract and the contract would transfer it to itself (the seller signed the transaction so that's ok)",,üî• (1)

As we all know.. the fallbacks are not executed, but can be coded and seen as thus 'operational' and as such users of the ledger loose their HBAR - as they could read the contract and verify the bytecode themselves and thus assume those functions are good and the  .sol special vars reflect the send and value..  which they don't as we all know.

Sure you lot are on it..  its a long standing issue(irritant to internal engineers/protocol and fundamentals- TPS etc).. I know.  no serious impact yet as Hedera still an embryo - which is good.

9.7616E+17,Francesco Coacci#2822,05/27/2022 11:57 AM,"I usually use IPFS, you can download IPFS desktop from their website here: https://ipfs.io/#install

9.7616E+17,Francesco Coacci#2822,05/27/2022 12:00 PM,I'll dm you,,
8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,05/27/2022 12:52 PM,"- A simple way is to do a mirror query for your nft, like (https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/tokens/0.0.34912938/nfts/1)

- You'll see that the metadata looks strange in that mirror query. That's because it's base64 encoded, so you have to decode it (I like this tool https://www.base64decode.org/). After decoding you'll see that the NFT metadata is what was provided during minting: ipfs://bafyreieqf3vnrpttxg45ea5rnhqvzt7ftee2sjlpqexoqya3qahmd4zah4/metadata.json

- You can then see that IPFS URI through a gateway link, like in the form of: 
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafyreieqf3vnrpttxg45ea5rnhqvzt7ftee2sjlpqexoqya3qahmd4zah4/metadata.json

The questions I have:
- Has anyone already proved that it's safe to reduce decimal places 18 to 6, on Uniswap V2? (I do believe it's more business decision, but just asking if anyone already had this problem and solved.)
- Can I use ERC20 interface's transfer function for HTS tokens? It supports `uint256` for `amount` field. I'm not sure if HTS token internally forcibly converts `uint256` amount to `int64`.",,

1. it's a read only call whereas the latter is potentially also a write and

Compare that to AWS DynamoDB where $0.25 gets you 1m RRU where a single RRU is at most 4KB. In other words the cost to read on DynamoDB is $0.00000025/4KB or about 60,000x cheaper than a contract read/query on Hedera's SC Service.

6.2301E+17,Bart#1307,06/04/2022 9:52 AM,"It's pretty simple in my mind. A `ContractExecuteTransaction` is executed by at least the supermajority of the network which has a network bandwidth of 15m gas/s. A local node has a higher gas bandwidth for example 115m gas/s.

If you have 30 nodes, that leaves a total read capacity of 30*100m gas/s(3B gas/s) for nodes to cumulatively process  `ContractCallQuery` requests locally, which is 200x what is reserved for `ContractExecuteTransaction`, hence the gas cost for `ContractCallQuery`  should be about 200x cheaper than the gas cost for `ContractExecuteTransaction`, or about $0.0000000569/200 = ~$0.0000000003",,

We left it out just from a healthy respect of ""unknown unknowns"".  The more battle-hardened that SC 2.0 becomes, the easier it will be to get this HIP accepted by the council.

In your shoes, with a contract that needs to negotiate the exchange of an `XYZ` NFT from Alice for hbar from Bob, *giving precedence to the `XYZ` royalty fee* instead of an hbar fallback fee, I would consider one of two work-arounds:

**Option one - Solidity workaround**
  - Set the `XYZ` royalty fraction `1/f` and `fallbackFee` amounts as part of contract state 
  - If Bob is paying `msg.value` hbar for the NFT, where `msg.value > fallbackFee`, then divert an additional `msg.value/f - fallbackFee` to the fee collector via `address.send(msg.value / f - fallbackFee)`.

**Option two - Simulated hbar workaround**
  - Create a fungible token `HbarProxy` with supply and wipe key, with your contract as the treasury
  - Ensure Alice, Bob, and the `XYZ` fee collector are associated to `HbarProxy` (worst part of this option)
  - At the start of the transaction, use `HederaTokenService.wipe()` to clear both Alice and Bob's `HbarProxy` balances (get these via `IERC20(HbarProxy).balanceOf(Alice)`, etc)
  - If Bob is paying `x = msg.value` hbar for the NFT, send Bob `x` units of `HbarProxy`
  - Do a `HederaTokenService.cryptoTransfer()` that exchanges Alice's NFT for Bob's `x` units of `HbarProxy`
  - Since fungible value is exchanged, the royalty will be applied
  - Check Alice's final balance `y` of `HbarProxy`; now `x - y` is the correct royalty to send to the fee collector via `address.send()` üòì",,

If the transaction is Alice sending Bob 1 NFT w/ custom fees, then the transfer will only succeed if Bob can afford the custom fee

If Bob sends, say 100 hbar in return, and the NFT creator set a 5% royalty, then Alice will only get 95 hbar and 5 hbar will go to the fee collector

Let‚Äôs say, Alice creates a scheduled transaction with an atomic swap of 1 NFT with a fallback fee of 10 hbar going from Alice to Bob in exchange for 100 hbar going from Bob to Alice. Now, Bob needs to sign the transaction. Let‚Äôs assume he does, but does not have 100 hbar but 50 hbar. Technically, the NFT transfer could proceed but the 100 hbar transaction could not. However, he could afford the fallback fee. Would this scheduled transaction fail completely with an error code or would the fallback fee be triggered?",,

Would it be possible to introduce a separate and cheaper gas price for `ContractCallQuery` given that the resource requirements for such a call are inherently cheaper than `ContractExecuteTransaction` and as such should be proportionally cheaper?

I estimate the gas price for `ContractCallQuery` to be at least 200x cheaper than `ContractExecuteTransaction`, assuming each node has a local gas limit of 115m gas/s of which 15m gas/s is reserved for the network leaving 100m gas/s for processing `ContractCallQuery` requests, assuming a network of 30 nodes, this allows for a net gas limit of 30*100 = 3B gas/s allocated to `ContractCallQuery`, which is 200x(3B/15m) the network level gas limit",,"üíØ (2),üëÄ (1)"

First, the feedback that validates your request:
  1.  Your thesis on the relative cost of query `gas` versus transaction `gas` is mostly correct; the latter resource is  constrained in a way the former is not.
  2. As shown by Ethereum, free `ContractCallLocal` queries are an important part of enabling high-value dapps.
  3. Free `ContractCallLocal` queries are 100% on the Hedera roadmap (via *zero-stake nodes* that participate in gossip but not consensus; these will be essentially real-time mirror nodes)
   
Note the ""mostly correct"" qualifier in #1. Even though queries don't compete for CPU time needed to handle transactions, they *do* compete for I/O buffers and disk bandwidth when accessing the `VirtualMap` s that store contract data (see https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-25, the most important HIP of them all). 

So if we facilitate `ContractCallLocal` queries against consensus nodes---though natural today---this creates a material headwind for our (very ambitious) internal roadmap for the contract service. Thus the decision in 0.26 to make it even *more expensive* to run `ContractCallLocal` queries against consensus nodes üòû.

In the short term, we hope many use cases can adapt by replacing ERC-style assets with HTS tokens managed and owned by contracts (now the contract ""state"" is native token balances that are visible through free `GetAccountBalance` queries---c.f. SaucerSwap)

In the medium term, it *may* be possible to enhance the record stream with contract storage information accessible through existing mirror nodes (with a few seconds latency)
 
But in the long term, we know we have to provide the ecosystem with free `ContractCallLocal`. Hedera and the council will have an open ear to the community in the meantime.",,

3.06966E+17,VR#1587,07/05/2022 1:35 PM,"Gentlemen! I'm happy to announce I finally put everything together to finalize a first edition of the tool which I believe solves our problems with randomness on blockchain. Well... tool is a big word, its a smart contract really, but a one we all should use in my opinion. 
I've written a sufficient explanation on how randomness works in general and why  we cant really use off-chain randomness (for example provided thru SDK from JS or Java) and I also laid out a bunch of other problems I see RNG needs solving to be sufficiently... random 
Full explanation is in Readme here : https://github.com/YV-Work/true-random and includes couple of examples both in solidity for on chain use and in JS for Hedera hashgraph SDK use. 
To further simplify your work and utilization I also created npm package here : https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yv-work/true-random-sol
this allows you to easily import TrueRandom Interface and Constants included in package through
`import ""@yv-work/true-random-sol/contracts/ITrueRandom.sol"";` without need to copy paste files into your remix IDE or just use npm install to integrate Javascript constants. 

Im very interested in your, the developers, critique and be sure to ask me if I didnt explain something sufficiently in text and or if you need more examples or perhaps a bit of change for your popular usecase. Im especially interested in @johnda98  opinion since I know you needed randomizer of sorts. 

Lastly, I still have not deployed it on mainnet because I cnsider this announcement a bit of a pre release review stage. I want to make sure I covered all basis and it is indeed the most efiicient yet secure and user friendly RNG mechanism and within a week from now we shall deploy it on mainnet both ETH and Hedera and make it accessible to the world üôÇ",,üëè (2)

6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/05/2022 5:36 PM,So if I wanted to incorporate dice rolls into an HCS-based game would it be worth it to use this for every roll? Do you have stats for the response time,,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,07/05/2022 7:35 PM,"The implementation depends on multiple points : 
- how are operations done 
- how fair/uncontrollable you want to be with your game mechanics 
- how cost effective do you have to be 

Lets say your game has dice rolls but the players are playing in lobbies. In this case, what is the issue of making per lobby roll storage? So lets say you have dice rolls array and in diceroll[room3] you have stored uint256 which you will use for next 10 steps. Now this means that theres a contract read attack hanging there, meaning potentially if Im really really smart and have very powerful PC and network is very public I can figure out diceroll[room3] value. 

HOWEVER, if your game logic is 4 people in lobbies are playing in rotation then it just means that I know RNG for current lobby is ""28653404855184049371"" and I know Im third in queue so the 04 falls on me if each player gets 2 digits of a ""roll"" can I do something with it? not really if I have to roll in sequence. 

If your game is asynchronous then its whole other story, I could wait for someone to use 04 and then go for it. In which case yes, I personally would use it for every dice roll. 

In both cases Im talking about on chain roll usage. response time is well... Im not even sure such thing exists between smart contracts. 

Now if I want to use diceroll logic off chain... oh boy, I dont think Id use anything like this at all bcs the question then becomes can I trust implementation of diceroll between SC response and whatever is player usage. 

Does it make sense?",,
6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/05/2022 8:07 PM,Yeah it wouldn't make sense to use it for something that's off chain. But maybe for something like GooeysP2E where the entire game is just RNG results from a smart contract. Or for game-related functions like minting NFT characters with seed-derived attributes.,,
6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/05/2022 8:08 PM,If the game is not doing a high volume of RNG values would you recommend this over Chainlink VRF,,
6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/05/2022 8:32 PM,"Lastly, if someone were to use the diceroll logic off chain. And let's say the complete history of that game is also stored in an HCS topic. Couldn't an off-chain game demonstrate the fairness of random outcomes by using this tool and including the dice roll's receipt in the HCS record? If players wanted to verify the fairness of a random outcome they could 1) check the in-game result 2) see if it matches result in the topic. As long as the dice roll's receipt is included and it matches what happened in-game wouldn't that prove the dice roll was fair?'",,
6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/05/2022 8:46 PM,I currently have to use static outcomes in an offchain game because I don't really have a way of proving fairness. But perhaps if I were able to include the receipts for an on-chain dice roll in a way that players could verify the in-game result matches the on-chain roll,,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,07/05/2022 9:53 PM,"Sorry for delayed response, so as is my understanding, initially I was going to use LINK VRF aswell but then I read about costs and you're supposed to pay premium of 0.25 LINK per call on top of gas cost. Now not only this dramatically complicates my balances across all contracts its also quite costly... Well not so much actually, thing is, Chainlink can provide up to 500 random numbers while my thing has just one chunk, 32 bits of random data. 
So it's more of a economy vs size, for some sort of enterprise generation where one call can distribute tens to hundreds RNGs I suppose LINK should be cheaper. But me myself I need more of an on demand singular response and for that LINK is enormously pricey as you have to pay 1 LINK for 4 users gen and ofc users wont be paying it form their wallets bcs you probably have your own tokens/nfts tied to transaction already so forcing them to use LINK aswell is dead sentence, so you gotta complicate entire thing so much just bcs Chainlink needs money...

I tried to avoid direct solution like this because I have to think a bit more cross platform but yeah, on Hedera specifically this is a good way of doing things... although then question rises ""what happened between RNG parse and output I see, how did 4395721475934021739641932745 convert to {Green, 3.7, True, 7} object or whatever so my personal idea is to put entire calculation on chain and only use on chain output (as in already finished objs) off chains by reference. Fortunately Hedera provides nice gas costs to do this",,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,07/05/2022 10:05 PM,"The thing that didnt make it into README is my personal experience: 
I worked in Casinos software biz for few years. Casinos in Europe nowadays are governed like banks, so we had audits, logs, laws to respect. And despite total gov control I've never seen a SINGLE client thinking he came into fair business üòÑ Literally everybody is always convinced that casino is always going to win and systme is rigged against you. Now despite this not being the case it always bothered me we cannot prove our algos are legit. Because you can make auditors print certificates, theres about ZERO guarantee we didnt change servers or algos after audits to screw with people. 
And on blockchain space everything is 10x worse we dont have to prove anything to state, platform or each other üòÑ So unless it is written in smart contract which I know can not be changed, I know I cant trust it. 
Or put the other way, I know I can prove to any user Im trustworthy if I can shove unchangeable smart contract logic in their faces. Only when user can verify something and verify something can't change after verification can it be considered truly fair. IMO",,

6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/05/2022 11:57 PM,but if the on-chain roll results in something that's directly translatable to the in-game event it should be enough to prove the result was fair,,
6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/05/2022 11:59 PM,or if each individual game was generated from a seed. and that seed is stored in the game's topic but encrypted. and then at the conclusion of the game a final message is sent to the game's topic with the encryption key. so that users know the game's key after it's over and can verify the in-game events match the seed,,
6.32378E+17,Bralz#7521,07/06/2022 12:02 AM,so the game server would use some overarching key as an envelope key. and would generate a unique key for each game. at each game's conclusion decrypt the unique key using the envelope key and send it to the HCS topic. not a crypto expert and not sure if having a record of different decrypted keys would allow a user to reverse engineer the envelope key,,

1. ""Does Hedera supports reveal functionality like used in Ethereum/Opensea where we change the base URI to change the cover image to actual images after the public sale?""
A: Once the metadata value is set on a newly minted NFT, you will not be able to change it on-chain to point to a new link (which hosts ur json file). If you want to update NFTs (ie dynamic NFTs) you will most likely need to host the json file on a server where you have write access. There may be more ""web3"" solutions regarding using Hedera File Service, but for now this is probably the easiest way, altho a bit web2. 

2. ""Is there an option to refresh metadata on Hashaxis/Zuse like there is on Opensea""
A:  I""m actually not certain and you would need to ask those teams specifically. 

3. ""What is the metadata standard followed by Hedera/Hashaxis/Zuse for NFTs?""

'keeps crashing' and 'unhelpful error messages' is somewhat blanket..   if you iron out all the REVERT exceptions in Remix.. that helps .. before deploying to testnet..   ok back to work here.

oh.. a common trip-up is ensuring you select uint256 from the Get methods when pulling the results of a Contract call..

I would expect the code in their documentation to actually work but it does not.

Keeps crashing is not blanket, it is a fact. It keeps crashing. 

Unhelpful error message is also a fact. What am I to do with an error message that simply says UNAUTHORIZED?? 

The documentation (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/consensus/errors) shows that this error corresponds to:
'An attempted operation was not authorized (ie - a deleteTopic for a topic with no adminKey)'

As already mentioned and as per the hedera java sdk documentation there is no method to pass a key when getting a TransactionReceipt object. As per the code in the documentation. The key is passed to the TransactionResponse object before running the execute method of that object. 

My getter function is returning a string memory, just like in the examples provided in the hedera java sdk documentation.

The documentation is inaccurate. There are also errors in it where the wrong object is being referenced, for example:

//Create the transaction
FileAppendTransaction transaction = new FileAppendTransaction()
    .setFileId(newFileId)
    .setContents(""The appended contents"");

//Change the default max transaction fee to 2 hbars
FileCreateTransaction modifyMaxTransactionFee = transaction.setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(2)); 

It should be:
FileAppendTransaction modifyMaxTransactionFee = transaction.setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(2));

Because 'transaction' is defined as an instance of FileAppendTransaction on the first line. IntellJ highlights that error and won't run the code until the correct object type is being used.

This leads me to believe that the code in the documentation was never tested.",,

If you have feedback on specific issues in documentation, please capture them in the issues section of the docs repository so the team can track and address them:

I would suggest looking into using  `ContractCreateFlow()` for contract deployment with the SDK. In a single call, it takes care of `FileCreateTransaction`, `FileAppendTransaction`, and `ContractCreateTransaction()`

8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,07/29/2022 8:02 AM,yes in release v0.26 (hit mainnet on June 9th). See the release notes here: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/release-notes/services#v0.26,,
6.8171E+17,vae.vecturne#3448,07/29/2022 8:11 AM,"> In this alpha release of Hedera Services 0.26, we are excited to deploy previewnet support for HIP-410 (Wrapping Ethereum Transaction Bytes in a Hedera Transaction). and HIP-415 (Introduction Of Blocks).
I noticed this, but was confused by the wording, it sounds like previewnet support was added for HIP-410 and HIP-415",,
8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,07/29/2022 8:25 AM,"This is a dev channel. Your question was recently posted... 
You may expect a response in 72 hours or less.

- `ContractCreateFlow` has the method `.setContructorParameter`. You can pass constructor arguments that way if you need do things like initialize state variables during contract deployement. For instance:

`const contractInstantiateTx = new ContractCreateFlow()
.setBytecode(bytecode)
.setGas(100000)
.setConstructorParameters(
   new ContractFunctionParameters().addAddress(tokenAddress)
);`

See details in documentation: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/smart-contracts/create-a-smart-contract

- The fileID being null seems like an SDK issue. I'll create an issue in the GitHub repo. In the future, feel free to create issues for bugs in the SDK for the team to track and fix here: (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/issues)

You can still get the file ID by doing mirror node queries (like https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/contracts/0.0.47774680) or checking a mirror node explorer like hashscan. If you search the account that paid for the tx, that shows all the steps that `ContractCreateFlow()` performs for you, so FileCreate, FileAppend, ContractCreate, FileDelete",,"üëç (1),üöÄ (1)"
8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,07/29/2022 8:29 AM,"Good point. That wording was likely the result of automation from when those items were first released to previewnet. Each release first hits previewnet, then testnet a few week later, and finally mainnet a few more weeks later. Updated the wording to avoid future confusion",,üôå (1)
4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,07/29/2022 11:57 AM,"@Aslam couple of thoughts to help solve your issue
* Are you using the latest version of the SDK (there was an issue uploading large files in the past where it took more than 2 minutes to upload the first few chunks of the file, leading to the prepared transactions for the next chunks to have expired, newer SDKs as far as I know generate transactions per chunk in real time to avoid this)
* Is your bytecode particularly large, could you try to run the solidity compiler with optimisation to reduce the bytecode.
* How do you create the contract ? 1. create the file, 2. create the contract, or do you use the contract creation flow from the SDK.",,

The keys are hex encoded ASN.1 format, which includes a header that specifies the algorithm and key parameters (see the source file). 
Keep in mind that the prefix is just metadata about the key itself. So what you'll see is that things like mirror nodes and HashScan take the raw key (w/o the metadata) and display it hex encoded, e.g. https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.34291612 - if you see your account keys from the hedera portal, you'll most likely see the prefix.

With that background in mind, I remember getting that error myself recently. Unfortunately, I can't remember what triggered it üòÖ
It's likely that you're specifying or passing keys between contracts in a way that conflicts with the info above.

Maybe that ^ line in the example repo will help with some ideas. Note that if you specify a **keyless **contract as a [supply/admin/etc] key for a token, then that related operation doesn't have to be signed - because the contract is keyless. JIC, line 70 in index.js shows how you can pass account keys from JS to the contract. Hope that helps",,

That means that the spender has to generate the tx ID or be the client.

I have a strong suspicion that this same issue affects working with the precompiles.... 
However, my issue with the precompiles had to do with associations (couldn't grant the allowance due to missing association, but the spender and token were associated).

my attempted use case is to issue a HTS FT using a smart contract as treasury deployed by a multsig wallet.

I read the above with interest - how can you see that's the error? I just have the unhelpful 'contract reverted' so would love to be able to get more detailed error information rather than my blunderbuss try things and hope it fixes a problem. Specifically, in my case the owner/deployer of the SC is the one making the call to approve() to setup a new allowance - in this case to itself (ideally of course to any account or SC) - on the token created by the SC and associated to the SC (treasury) and the calling account too.",,
8.58141E+17,Ed Marquez#6403,09/15/2022 4:54 PM,"Not worries at all, @Deejay.  

I detailed in [this GH issue](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-smart-contracts/issues/67) what I'm running into and the errors that I'm getting. Basically, even though an account and token are already associated, the contract can't approve the allowance because it doesn't think the association has happened. 

Running into `contract revert`  can be frustrating indeed. We're working on improving the troubleshooting for those cases. If that happens, that may mean that more gas is needed, an parameter is being passed incorrectly, or a function is called incorrectly, or something like that.",,

I want to make a transaction on a smart contract by signing it with account A and submit the transaction with Account B such that update(or whatever transaction it is) happens by A but B pays for it.
Any Idea how I can do?

I tried using freezing with operator B and signing with private key A and the submitting(execute) with operator B but that seems to show the in the record(hashscan) that transaction came from B and not A.

I tried same thing with a TransferTransaction sending hBar, that worked i.e. hBar were transferred from Account A but the transaction fee was paid by B.

Any Idea how can I do that with hedera JS sdk ?

I'm currently trying my hand at implementing my first SC on Hedera and am not sure about the best way to test my contracts locally. I want to implement a simple contract that utilizes HTS to create a token and mint an NFT for starters.

I've written the contract and have setup my environment using Truffle, however I'm not sure what the easiest way to connect to a testnet node is. I can specify the network I want to test with in the `truffle-config.js`, but the network settings don't seem to have an option for adding accounts along with their private keys. I'm looking for something similar to the hardhat config in this repo: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-hardhat-hethers, but using Truffle as Hardhat does not seem to be fully supported according to the docs. 

Just running `truffle develop` works for executing the contract, but as HTS makes calls to `address(0x167)`, which is not available on truffle's develop network, I can't properly test HTS functionalities.

What is the easiest way to set up a local environment that allows testing contracts using HTS? Should I ditch Truffle and go with something else? I'd appreciate some pointers!",,

On ETH you would use a local node (e.g. using hardhat), so latency and rate limits are no issue, as far as I understand there is nothing resembling this functionality for Hedera development yet?

I've actually gotten it to work quite well by setting up a local node using https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-local-node.

1) How to schedule a transaction from a smart contract to call itself n days from now (i.e. a smart contract that is self governed and does not require any human interactions)
2) How to get a smart contract to stake to a node with its stored HBAR to earn passive HBAR to help self-sustain the smart contract forever.

If I need to enter HIPS for these, let me know. Or if a DEV could reach out to me for a short 1 on 1 chat over discord that would be good too.",,
7.63487E+17,aseidma#2141,10/12/2022 4:36 AM,Is there a way to use console logs within smart contracts on Hedera?,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,10/12/2022 9:14 AM,not in a traditional semantic of 'console logs' ...   I recommend thrash test your contract in remix IDE against in-mem chain.. test your calls etc... for no reverts ....  you can then add some public variables in your contract that you can set to differing values as it executes through.. and thus reflect state changes ... then when its deployed to a hedera node you can have your DApp pull the getter methods in the Contract with a ContractQuery and see the state changes/data of the public variables and get a sense of where and what your Contract is doing - actual vs/expect.,,
7.63487E+17,aseidma#2141,10/12/2022 9:22 AM,"Thank you, I've actually been able to somewhat get a ""console log""-like experience by emitting custom events during testing and pretty-printing them in the unit test code using the response truffle gives me.
Do you (or perhaps does someone else) know a go-to way to unit-test SCs?

I've been playing around with truffle and have gotten it to work fine with a local node, but have yet to find something similar to calling `setPayableAmount` on `ContractExecuteTransaction`. Otherwise all calls from the contract (using Truffle) to HTS fail with error code 9, meaning insufficient gas as far as I understand.
Using the SDK in unit tests would probably work as well, but would require setting up a separate client and introduce another dependency to the testing environment, which I would like to avoid.",,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,10/12/2022 9:30 AM,"like I said.. I unit-test SCs fully in remix - but of course not SCs with precompile calls in them.      why dont you just deploy to testnet and simply spool up a simple maven java project in intellij and paste in a bunch of calls from the sdk HH repo  to test your SC .. thats what I do...

its actually a more cost efficient. time and labour ..  simply try to forget the term 'unit-test' and just deploy to testnet - its more efficient since you have hts calls",,
7.63487E+17,aseidma#2141,10/12/2022 9:43 AM,"I've gotten it to work in a local environment that includes precompile calls (basically your remix setup except I also have access to precompiled contracts) and it works really well except for the transaction call not being built properly by truffle. So it's really not that much of a reach to get this working and have a local, fast and reliable way of running automated tests against a network that can be entirely reset easily.
I understand your argument about cost effectiveness in relation to time and labour, however there are always tradeoffs and testing against live services (namely testnet) comes with it's own downsides in terms of reliability, maintainablity and cost.",,üëçüèº (1)

What I'm interested in how to schedule a call from a smart contract to itself from a specific time in the future using scheduled transaction.

Dr. Leemon Baird said back in March 2022 in the video I linked above:

*""So if you wanted to do something like a bond that is making payments every month once a month, the smart contract needs to make a payment well. How does it know when to do it? Some human has to remember to send it a message once a month to make a call to it once a month to wake it up and then they can do the thing to make it do the payment you can set up to be secure. ... *

*""A smart contract, well it's running the first time one of the thing it can do it call the hedera transaction that creates a scheduled transaction that a month from now we'll call the smart contract. It makes some payments on its bond and then before it goes to sleep it makes another one for a month in the future and it just keeps doing that forever and now it's alive. You can have actual smart contracts that are living in a real sense and since it has its own um store of hbars you know it could be funded to run for millions of years and it could be set up so that it maybe earns money in some ways in which case it's alive. it's an entity that will run forever and it just keeps going forever""*

This is exactly what I'm after. Has this been implemented yet in Smart Contract 2.0? Or is there an existing HIP or a work task for this? Do I need to create a HIP?

Thanks",,

(Easy to do outside of course more hoping to make it seamless for msg.sender if they have not got the token associated then try to do so from the contract).

That's why the `IERC721(token).balanceOf` returns 0 without any association info. 

One approach to explore (probably expensive and not ideal for most use cases, but thinking out loud here) could be to try the `associateToken` precompile (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/smart-contracts/hedera-service-solidity-libraries#associatetoken-account-tokens). If the tx doesn't go through, you can get the error to confirm that the token is already associated with the account. If it goes through, it wasn't associated. Again, not an ideal way to do that type of query, but it will get you the info in Solidity lol.

In the near future, there will be a mirror node REST API request that will get you that information, but as you know, that's outside of Solidity.",,üëç (1)

Aligns with where I fell out indeed. 100% this works and is indeed what I have resorted to just means over gassing the transaction call by 1mm in case an association is needed - per my off the cuff talk with myself above I do have a mapping so have a clean heuristic of whether to attempt the association or not so at least the user will get 200k gas back if it were not needed. Will work on the front end to notice if the user had already been through the contract so does not need to associate and thus can remove the extra gas but given lags in the SLA for association will stick to supplying too much ‚õΩÔ∏è given it‚Äôs not that expensive in $$ terms for the improved user experience of not needing a two step process when time pressured.,,"üíØ (1),üëç (1)"

I have had CODE_OVERSIZE before - the contract was over the spurious dragon size limit by a few bytes.

The other thought would be are you chunking the bytecode upload? each Hedera transaction is maxed at 6kb so larger files you have to create the HFS file and then append to it. Various ways to handle it but need to see what exactly you are doing in the code to make suggestions on what might be wrong.

If I understood correctly, contracts deployed from other contracts and contracts deployed through the Relay node (Ethereum transactions in both cases) will always have an Admin = None. If that is the case, would it be possible to set such contracts as Token Admin keys and/or Treasury Accounts? If my understanding is correct, in order to set a contract as a Token admin key/treasury, you need the contract's admin to sign the transaction, but these contracts would not have admins....",,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:31 PM,In that link I shared there is also an article on royalties,,
8.12812E+17,Crypto.Sheraz#2758,11/24/2022 5:31 PM,Do you think it would be much easier to do it off chain?,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:31 PM,The biggest hurdle is dealing with royalties when present.,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:31 PM,I don‚Äôt think so. I believe it is right to do it on chain,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:33 PM,Depends. Fallback fees make it tricky. If no fallback fee then easier. Even then it is possible to work around it (at the risk of getting inbound that I am trying to do something against design),,
8.12812E+17,Crypto.Sheraz#2758,11/24/2022 5:34 PM,So in this case there is no fallback fee or royalty,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:34 PM,It‚Äôs always doable just needs some careful thought,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:35 PM,You can move them by casting the tokens to be IERC20 and user the transfer function (safeTransfer not available last I checked) or use Hedera precompile methods (I prefer this option myself),,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:35 PM,Make sure the contract has the token associated,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:36 PM,And should be fine.,,
8.12812E+17,Crypto.Sheraz#2758,11/24/2022 5:39 PM,"So in the smart contract, i wrap the nft colelction address into IERC20, use associatetoken and transfernft? like this?

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:40 PM,you only need to associate the token ID once (not per serial),,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:40 PM,it costs ~950k gas / ~5c so you don't want to be doing it so much,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:41 PM,transferring looks fine from memory without looking up the API,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:42 PM,you don't need to cast to IERC20 here as you are using Hedera native methods,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,11/24/2022 5:48 PM,no need to have an approval step like ETH as the token is native via HTS rather than existing because of a contract deployment...although association is a different (mostly good) friction,,

yes.. I see if your process that requires atomicity has to operate on content itself... not just a hash of the content.. then yes only the App can do this and refeed result back to SC ..   then yes the Game player must trust the App/backend to feed itself.. that trust comes over time and usage..  

yep.. limitations of immutable process capability within a SC.

Can't you keep additional primitive data type 'state' in the NFT meta data that is related and thus bound at mint time to the ipfs related content and reflects the contents 'value' that is later needed in calculations? - that way the off chain process/examination of the ipfs content to effect the calculation will not be necessary and the SC can process that state change/data before minting the resultant NFT.",,

well you can save like

considering  owner can be verified and we know other metadata dont matter it's as good as balance.

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/02/2022 8:29 AM,Will you want the user to sign the transaction? If so I would recommend the hashconnect demo the hashpack devs stood up. It uses angular however that‚Äôs less important - it shows you how to call a smart contract from the front end.

If you put the supply key in the contract then it can be used to mint more subject to the the capacity comment. TL:DR; having access to the supply key is the authorisation. Minted tokens will be delivered to the treasury account originally used so whilst the SC may mint them they will (reasonably sure) land in the original treasury which might not be what you are after?

I have tended to go the other way and use a SC as treasury to mint HTS tokens and then provide access control using solidity access control / ownable etc.

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/05/2022 7:46 AM,To be a pedant - the supply key (not the private key).,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/05/2022 7:50 AM,INVALID_SIGNATURE is what I would have expected. Or just an update to https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/deprecated/sdks/smart-contracts/errors (or similar) so a search might find a useful hint as to what the issue could be.

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/05/2022 7:51 AM,Only if you choose it to be. Generally it is a separate Key. If you use the SC to mint then you can get around this. If you have the token already out in the wild then a token swap could be managed with/without a SC,,
3.064E+17,samuelnihoul#9657,12/05/2022 7:53 AM,OK! I think I'll move the treasury to the smart contract. I have no idea how to do that though üò¶,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/05/2022 7:58 AM,Around the requirement to sign with a supply key externally (if the SC is treasury you can authorise it as the key and then it is trivial to mint additional supply / burn etc.). I will have a think if there might be yet another way around this to help you.,,üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (1)
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/05/2022 8:13 AM,Credit @kantorcodes - @samuelnihoul  your more suited option might be to to update the token supply key to be the Smart Contract using a TokenUpdateTransaction() (will need to sign the update transaction with the admin key).

7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/07/2022 10:57 AM,the platform that sports the contract should have the .sol opensource.. so you can compile it with same RUNS/ optimize parms and the bytecode should match the bytecode in the FIleID that their platform calls,,

7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/08/2022 12:55 PM,eh ?   I dont 'guess' .. and nooooop imho  any deployed Contract resulting in a ContractID is bound immutably to its corresponding bytecode.   You did not clarify what you mean by 'upgradability',,
9.50496E+17,Michael Garber#5033,12/08/2022 12:56 PM,You can set a threshold key. For instance if you wanted 2 keys and only needed 1 to sign your threshold key would be 1 of 2 (N of M) https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/keys/create-a-threshold-key,,
9.50496E+17,Michael Garber#5033,12/08/2022 12:59 PM,Oh but you are talking about smart contracts,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/08/2022 1:00 PM,@samuelnihoul Oh I see you meant I guessed at your definition of 'upgradability' and guessed right.   ok.. well the answer is deployed bytecode cannot 'be to/overlay/upgrade' the same FileID as a prior deploy.  Files are created and appended to.. 'updating bytecode' in the same File is a no-no.  For obvious reasons.. Thats what differentiates Contracts executed in a VM on-chain from a executable that is changeable by the 'author',,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/08/2022 1:00 PM,@Michael Garber he's talking about deploying tokens from Contract,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/08/2022 2:46 PM,Can generally be adjusted for in design if needed. I have grown fond of immutability to be honest (noting it makes certain use cases a little tricker),,üëç (1)
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/08/2022 3:23 PM,"depends on use-case yep..  all .sol should be open source and the bytecode file used for Contract create, shown on explorers, should, when Solc'd with runs/optimize of original compile, match perfectly with the open source shown by the App..    Etherscan of course for years now has matched that and marked a contract as such.. for Ethereum.    I can still see my early 2018 deploy of 'edisoncoin' on etherscan.io with my code confirmed.. very cool for Customers to see and to link too.

What I do for any changes in Contract logic is announce new App release, change the ipfs link to images of the source and notify of new bytecode file and any Contracts deployed by the App put that fileid in the Contract create memo as meta data..   as far as the ci cd pipe is concerned,  Customers on prior App release still operate on the prior Contract version.. so  both are always sync'd and Customers migrate to latest release as their business is done and their Contracts fall off after 90 days 

..so any Customer can simply have their staff aka 'lowly Dev' .. key in the .sol form the new hash link , compile it and match the code to that pulled from the File on hedera - if they so wish.

and due to the <90 day deploy, the customer knows if it pays out and is left at 0 then it will fall off ledger soon thereafter  and that is within their 'expectations' for the App's purpose.  IF they choose to leave huge sums in the contract forever.. that is fine also.. as its their balance and they pay the auto-renew.

Of course it would be nice, like I suggested to Hedera, that if a use-case wants to deploy a contract with  say 2 years immutability.. then the gas/tran fee is priced as such to the nodes upon Create and the auto-renew is set as such.. so IF it pays out and balance is now zero then it will still be there for 2 years with all its state current.",,"üëç (1),üëÜ (1)"
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/08/2022 3:27 PM,@johnda98 sounds like you need to author a new HIP,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/08/2022 3:37 PM,"It was discussed in this thread I think a few weeks ago.. Scullard and Ed are on-it I think.. oh thats right Michael(core). said that if a Contract expired with Assets still owned by it. and hbar 0 of course.. then Assets would get transferred to a 'hedera account ie a trustee account' or something similar... as opposed to the Assets getting sent back to their Treasury ! 

oops..  yes say  Circle gets a windfall of someone elses 1mill$ worth of USDC or a valued 'Deejay' NFT worth a few mill gets set back to its treasury or some key

I think I retorted that a 'trusted' account .. is probably Gregs.. who then runs off to Argentina (better weather there).

thats how the discussion of me suggesting hey.. pay nodes upfront on Create for a > 90day immutable rental period..   no prob for my customers.. they'd love to pay 5$ or plenty more so to keep stuff in state for 6 months + or so without worry if the contracts bal fell to 0(for whatever reason)..  question is.. can the slippery Hedera Vine handle having 'heavy leaves' hanging from its stems for such a long period.. without slowing the TPS rate",,

and I know the limit of the state store data envelope .. so its fairly static and of course under the Hedera limit..  so the case 'fits'.   interesting eh..",,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,12/11/2022 12:50 PM,"Well ipfs only helps a bit with minted nfts which is merely 20% of the problem. Still, as I said first limitation lies in the fact that everything has to be powered by token and that's already a hard cap at 200k users. 
Not to mention next cap : nfts which users hold have to be transferred to ""vaults"" for events of sort (because an nft in sense of participation key has to be locked during participation so you can't sell it while using it) 
Then, assuming you need to lock up at least 4 nfts or even 8 per user we get a 160bit => 160bit[] 
Mapping of who owns what in the vault with each array being 160*4 or 160*8 even 
That brings us to way over 100B per user so we're limited at <100k active players due to logistics which can't be avoided unless you really like double spending for the sake of space. 

And going to Eth L1 is not a solution since you're basically saying you give up on a cheap and effective solution and now you have to raise prices of everything 10x because who the hell would pay 30usd to mint an nft which is supposed to have 10usd base cost of which only 5 goes to us.

I would sit back .. light a Cigar.. discuss with yourself if there is anyway further you can partition the data into measure of 'value'  that warranted needed to be held in consensus state - it sounds like u have done this though..    if you are down to the core .. then yes .. maybe examine if its time to go MongoDB and have Bob the sysop(who doesnt like Argentina) to be responsible for the game data,,

7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 1:37 PM,"before i go.. I ran across limits of the 1024k File size .. but luckily my case is SCs drop off literally after 90days in their 'purpose'.. so my limit X = 1024K/ SC Id as solidity address + delimiter ...  many thousands of SCs in 90days - which is fine..  fairly low vol case.   

built a backend 'trim' facility to trim off the old addresses from the file if >90 days and 0 balance and spit out a new File.. can do that real-time - so no CICD hard-code releases - FileId to access is one last appended as the native DApp references a 'file of files' and picks up the last appended fileid..  yes @VR a layering architecture but for ease of maintaining the stored state within its limits for the time period of the lifecycle of the SCs in my case.

unless <90day volumes exceed tens of thousands of SC creates... doubtful.",,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 1:39 PM,"yeah.. VR .. can't u keep your vault .. list of NFTs, in a encrypted ipfs file and append to it new NFTs added to 'vault' and just store the new 'vault file' CID back in your SC",,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,12/11/2022 1:41 PM,So run an ipfs file update on each player joining game? Definitely not lol. Also that is basically off chain computation so you're suggesting web2 solution,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 1:43 PM,well maybe think of it as 'on-chain'.. as the CID is held immutable and if you pin the encrypted content it will not only be held on your ipfs desktop/node but maybe the user can pull the file to nodes closer to them - so faster access also.,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 1:45 PM,nooope.. have a ipfs encrypted vault file PER user ..  that CID is held in the mapping in the SC.. maybe eh,,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,12/11/2022 1:45 PM,That's still web2 because noone can guarantee legitimacy of pinned file let alone downgrade from normal DB speed of access,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 1:47 PM,the CID is unique to its encrypted contents..   no one can change that content on ipfs and still have its CID hash match its hash held in your SC mappping of vaults,,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,12/11/2022 1:47 PM,Except it's my server that puts file on ipfs in first place and nobody can guarantee legitimacy of it because blockchain is no longer involved at all,,

So no user involvement here.",,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 1:51 PM,oh yes.. I see.. so you have to have consensus held state.. not just held state... and the minimum is the NFT address and would be yes binary own or do not own as min meta data .. at large scale.,,
3.06966E+17,VR#1587,12/11/2022 1:51 PM,"At the same time you gotta remember that hey ""nft76639255"" belongs to ""user103853467"" because when he quits you want to return it to his wallets.",,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/11/2022 2:03 PM,"Thanks for sharing @VR 

You could have a top-level factory/proxy that you interact with and then deploy storage contracts as required sized to handle X users based on max NFTs to stake. The user then either interacts with the top-level factory and is redirected to stake into the relevant storage contract or gets the address of the contract to interact with that is gated by authorized users to allow staking in/out with a method for the factory to query some summary of what's held. Still going to need an address-> to address mapping, but at least it's fairly flat irrelevant of the number of NFTs/serials staked.",,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/11/2022 2:11 PM,"how about this...

granular escrow.

each user has an individual SC they interact with for escrow. (you deploy an instance for them - it adds the user address as an immutable state variable). They stake to this contract and when they enter the game you verify the NFTs owned and place a lock on the escrow. When they exit the game they log out and you release the hold on the escrow so they can withdraw. avoids all collateral being in one big treasury pot. 

You store user vs escrow SC address in off-chain, when user enters the game you look-up the address and pass to your SC which verifies by querying the address for the immutable user address to ensure it has not been corrupted.",,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/11/2022 2:12 PM,unsure what you need to know about the users NFTs but with a little thought on the interface this route would allow you to embed some business logic here too. you are deploying it from your deployer factory so you should be comfy with what it can/can't do,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 2:12 PM,a immutably locked consensus state for lifecycle of a 'session',,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/11/2022 2:13 PM,and then it is upgradable,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/11/2022 2:13 PM,indeed,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/11/2022 2:15 PM,negates the real-time state keep overhead..  maybe yes the user can set the granularity level.. so they trade off cost/flexibility of 'use' ie 'trade' of that NFT ... they can 'lock it' and un lock..  but within 'limits' of the architecture of the tech,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/11/2022 2:15 PM,as an added benefit these user level escrow accoutns likely under the 100 K/V pairs so will be exempt from SC rent,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/11/2022 2:25 PM,"for sure you can store it on chain for the mapping...not sure i agree with the why bother with blockchain bit:

user has certainty on their NFT collateral. Only they can put NFTs in / take them out, all you can do is lock the state when needed to prevent it leaving and ensure it.

you get to store data in your DB that is untrusted but when user tries to enter you compare msg.sender to the immutable address in the referenced granular escrow contract to be sure it's the right one and go lock it to ensure immutable session state. 

if ever the user / escrow mapping in the DB were corrupted user could still find their escrow account to remove collateral as it's in the blockchain historical state as they interacted with it on the way in. So there would be a recovery ability of some kind.

I agree the on-chain mapping has merit however I think this approach outlined would scale much better with limited impact (?)*

I've been able to successfully create a token in the past; however, I just updated my smart contract to use the updated HTS precompile contracts and I keep getting a CONTRACT_REVERT_EXECUTED error when creating a token (receiving a `HederaResponseCodes.UNKNOWN` response). I'm following the `TokenCreateContract.sol` example, here‚Äôs a snippet of my current code:
¬†
I've tried the following in an attempt to debug:
* setting expiry with `createAutoRenewExpiry()`, `IHederaTokenService.Expiry` (using defaultAutoRenewPeriod and 8000000 from the example), and leaving expiry unset
* using different types of key values (e.g. CONTRACT_ID, DELEGETABLE_CONTRACT_ID, INHERIT_ACCOUNT_KEY)
* using different combinations of key types (e.g. ADMIN, SUPPLY, FREEZE, etc.)
* sending different hbar values in the contract call ranging from 15-100 hbar (`{ value: 100}`)
* adjusting the contract call gas, ranging from 3,000,000-15,000,000
¬†
One thing I find interesting is that no matter how much gas I send in, almost all of it is used up (above the 80% automatic usage) so it looks like the call might be running out of gas, but I have no idea why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/15/2022 1:02 PM,really..  like a wETH contract or so..  so its Only Saucer that have a working payable fallback or receive() that executes logic within those methods ?  üòâ  or maybe they just permit deposits to the contract id without having to know in the contract who sent it in,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/15/2022 1:04 PM,oh I'll have to RTFM then.. assumed it was the SC balance was last resort before Grace period exception warning. üôÇ,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/15/2022 1:07 PM,thats what my SCs do.. Account of same number as SC by default - reflecting the same balance as address(this).balance.  ....  I'll have to read up tho on what the SCs 'proxy account ' is.   Not so easy to keep up with the doc updates and code at the same time...  but of course any 'non-devs' would ask 'why not?'   lol ;). talkers...,,
8.87864E+17,littletarzan#5253,12/15/2022 1:16 PM,we can't execute a fallback if users deposit directly to a contract outside the EVM,,

7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/15/2022 2:39 PM,@littletarzan so you guys don't use the Contract instance's 'proxy Account' ?  than can be created upon Create.

8.87864E+17,littletarzan#5253,12/15/2022 2:48 PM,is the proxy account related to native staking?,,

7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/15/2022 3:15 PM,"well.. yes you could hold any balance difference identified,  be nicer (but not technically pretty probly) to have a working fallback or receive that simply returned any incoming back to msg.sender  Or processed the deposit as if it came in via a frnt/end contract execute call to a reg payable func.    yep.   maybe in future sdk if it didnt warrant a lower stack re-engineer. etc.",,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/15/2022 3:17 PM,maybe.. indeed..   I'll dig in docs when i get a chance see if it shows its purpose eh.,,

Strictly speaking immutably ethically, those Assets should be lost if Users fails to pay rent. imho.  User be warned in any use case that gives Customer ownership of a contract thats >90days autorenew .. moreover if a User has Assets held in a Platform's Contract that has autorenew >90days - then they should 'trust' üòâ the platform/ admin key to pay the rent.",,
8.87864E+17,littletarzan#5253,12/15/2022 3:29 PM,"true, any user can send rent payment directly to the contract holding the tokens though",,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,12/15/2022 3:29 PM,@littletarzan Maybe a Contract should have a 'rent escrow' account that holds a balance upon create that is untouchable by admin key and the balance held would cover auto-renew rent payments immutability for however long the deployer wishes..  ie rent paid in advance for the use-case immutable lifecycle of its purpose.   I'll have to read Ed's recent rent anoucement see if that covers it,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/20/2022 12:51 PM,TL:DR; use the image tag for the lower res 'thumbnail' then include the high quality file(s) using a files attribute.,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,12/21/2022 5:08 PM,a resolvable ID tied to a person secured by DLT. different people may well define it differently but I think most would agree something like a .hbar name from the hashgraph.name team or an ENS name on ETH would count as a DID.,,

3.06966E+17,VR#1587,12/29/2022 10:16 AM,"I was thinking about general pattern designs and initially I used Proxy just to maintain state for some props and when `Contract A` is replaced it boots up all Interfaces with 5 addresses from `Proxy B` to call others like this:
```
Contract A <-> Proxy B
then
Contract A <-> Proxy B
           <-> Contract C
           <-> Contract D
           <-> Contract E
           <-> Contract F

because my assumption was it's faster (cheaper) to initialise direct connection 
But as I now get to a point where there's 
```
Contract A <-> Proxy B
+
Contract J <-> Proxy B
Contract K after J has done its job

then
Contract A <-> Proxy B
           <-> Contract C
           <-> Contract D
           <-> Contract E
           <-> Contract F

Contract J,K,L <-> Contract D
               <-> Contract G

It seems to me that the shift to 
```
Contract A     <->   Proxy B  <-> Contract C
Contract J,K,L <->            <-> Contract D
                              <-> Contract E

2.82818E+17,Jadge#7614,01/02/2023 6:09 AM,@Deejay Thanks for taking time to reply. I want to mint 2999 NFTs each 1 of 1 (images with metadata) rather than using a service like mintbar (nothing against the service) where it will mint 1 nft at a time and input metadata (attributes one by one). All NFTs data (images+metadata) can be bulk uploaded to IPFS (such as NFT storage) for a minting script to call NFT storage api. I'm new to HBAR and don't really know how smart contract can be used for minting large number of NFTs in one go.

this way a User see a use-case of a SC and verifies the autorenew and can say to themselves.. ok cool.. this Platforms usecase's lifecycle is 6 months 184 days or so..  and held immutable until then(ie first rent due).. no need to check if platform has paid rent by calling its contract to see if it excepts or to set a calendar to get Assets out - if they see renew account is 0 and SC holds 0 HBAR.

Usecase/platform can pre-pay its Landlord and that pre-pay is paid/final.. and can be seen publicly by a User off the bat... as opposed to having to validate platforms's promises to its Users that they will pay a rolling 92 days...  or say a User having to check that to see if a platform has paid and/or hbar held is not 0.

right now a SC based marketplace for native HTS tokens - sadly - does not work until the cryptoTransfer() [v3] method as specified is implemented / turned on as you can't handle royalties **if there is a fallback fee** other than in certain defined corner cases. Until then it's variants of centralized custody (allowance spends / escrow, both requiring trust of the counterparty).

An HTS NFT token is broadly compatible with acting as an ERC721 token for Solidity if that helps. If you deploy an NFT using an ERC721, you would have to rely on (and maybe build) the infrastructure to handle them correctly. 

If you want to have an NFT with enhanced functionality then I would suggest minting the NFT from a Smart Contract and adding advanced functionality around it. If you just want to mint an NFT then I would got with a native HTS token as it will give you a simpler and better outcome. Open to having my mind changed of course!",,

the other way - which is what I use for the FT implementation - is to set the contract up as the wipe key, then you can wipe (burn) them without the transfer step (better if fallback fees on the royalties). Of course a wipe key is not ideal for trust but if you mint from the SC, leave the SC as the wipe key then encapsulate access control to msg.sender then you can ensure the user is control but you can still achieve the use case.",,

4.29324E+17,Greg Scullard#5365,03/10/2023 4:09 AM,"as far as I know, approve doesn't increase the existing allowance, it replaces it with the new allowance, so if the allowance is 10 and you approve 5, the allowance becomes 5 (I could be wrong)",,
1.02899E+18,alberto-IoBuilders#0345,03/10/2023 4:11 AM,"that's exactly what approve does, and that is why the vulnerability exists. I initially approve 10, I change my mind and I want to allow you to spend only 5, I send a new approve, but in the meantime you spend those 10. Once my new approve arrives, you have already spent 10 (your allow balance is 0), now you can spend 5. Result : you can potentially spend 15....",,
1.02899E+18,alberto-IoBuilders#0345,03/10/2023 4:13 AM,"if instead of approving 5, I ""decrease"" the allow balance by 5, worst case scenario you can only spend 10 (the initial allowance), my transaction decreasing the allowance will fail...",,

9.84352E+17,Harut#8853,03/11/2023 12:34 PM,Can anyone provide sources for learning token creation flow(except hedera docs) and router for liquidity providing... Thanks in advance,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,03/11/2023 6:44 PM,fallback doesnt trip in Hedera's evm @Deejay  yr current events didnt trip right?  akin to my tests 6 months ago of a payable fallback,,
7.82672E+17,johnda98#4728,03/11/2023 6:45 PM,if u send hbar to contractID it will credit the contracts account but not trip fallback ie msg.value n sender are null.  been like that for years... as that process inprotocol would affect TPS rate etc... thats ok.,,

1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,03/12/2023 6:08 AM,fallback trips if you get a method mismatch but not on a native hbar send to a contract,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,03/12/2023 6:08 AM,it is tokenBurn not token disassociate,,
1.59035E+17,Deejay#0076,03/12/2023 6:09 AM,"token disassociate removes the linkage of a given token from an account so you can no longer send it to that account.

you are looking either for burn (if the token is in the treasury account) or wipe (from any other account)",,
