I want to mint 2999 NFTs each 1 of 1 (images with metadata) rather than using a service like mintbar (nothing against the service) where it will mint 1 nft at a time and input metadata (attributes one by one). All NFTs data (images+metadata) can be bulk uploaded to IPFS (such as NFT storage) for a minting script to call NFT storage api. I'm new to HBAR and don't really know how smart contract can be used for minting large number of NFTs in one go. I want to achieve something matt woodward did with his minting script ( Youtube Title - How to Mint an NFT on Hedera Token Service (HTS) using the JS SDK).","",""

Usecase/platform can pre-pay its Landlord and that pre-pay is paid/final.. and can be seen publicly by a User off the bat... as opposed to having to validate platforms's promises to its Users that they will pay a rolling 92 days...  or say a User having to check that to see if a platform has paid and/or hbar held is not 0.

right now a SC based marketplace for native HTS tokens - sadly - does not work until the cryptoTransfer() [v3] method as specified is implemented / turned on as you can't handle royalties **if there is a fallback fee** other than in certain defined corner cases. Until then it's variants of centralized custody (allowance spends / escrow, both requiring trust of the counterparty).

Eventually I believe we will see state exposed on mirror nodes (see mirror node release notes for direction of travel) to make queries free without needing network resources so no gas.

""The transferToken and transferNFT APIs will behave as transfer in ERC20/721 if the caller owns the value being transferred, otherwise it will rely on approve spender allowances from the token owner.""
----

Can I check my priors, please?

The EOA providing explicit approval seems to be inconsistent. Calling a contract and signing appears fine for FT movements (no explicit approvals) but not fine for NFT movements. 

We make use of cryptoTransfer(TokenTransferList[] memory tokenTransfers) (**the older v2 signature given v3 is not implemented**) to handle NFT staking via Smart Contracts -- **this appears to be a breaking change -- SPENDER_DOES_NOT_HAVE_ALLOWANCE**.  I tried removing royalties - this method was used to accommodate NFTs with fallback fees - and switching to **transferNFTs** and I still get the same error.

Was it intended to break this behaviour? 

As above, other similar transactions like transferring FT from msg.sender to the contract ( using  transferToken() ) are still working fine, leaving the FT vs NFT behaviour inconsistent. I know in Eth land we have a two step approval process borne out of necessity not usability - hopefully it was not an attempt to mimic that üò≠ (potentially 3 step on Hedera, associate, approve, interact...granted I try to make it as seamless as possible and associate inside the contract call but wanted to illustrate the point).

- transfer NFT from the user

I am being selfish of course but hard to swallow that contracts you deployed with the intention of being immutable will stop working in 3 months and that other designs about to be released will have to be overhauled, resulting in a degraded user experience.

For example, if I deployed the project on ETH I would use an ERC-1155 for all the NFT collections and the Fungible Token.  As a result it could be 1 approval for the user to sign to give the contract permission to interact with all tokens. Plus there would be no association step. So 2 messages (approval / interact) to sign.

By virtue of HTS - which I appreciate so very much vs standing up basic architecture every time - each minted NFT token is separate. As such if I then need to interact with my staking contract I have to ask the user to sign to grant approval of all serials of each NFT collection on top of the association step. 

net/net: it's a choice between a high friction and ultimately poor user experience, or restructuring all collections onto a single jumbo token to mimic (poorly) ERC-1155 which is a rubbish experience for other reasons.

Said differently, just because it looks like ETH in the basic case does not always make it right. I am keen to keep the benefits of HTS not force ourselves to the dark ages of rolling ERC20/721/1155 just to be more ETH like.","","ü§î (1),üëç (2)"

With these changes, it is now a minimum of 5 signed transactions (2 associations + 2 approve + contract call), you can imagine how poor the user experience is becoming now.

For Non Fungible Tokens, looks like the only way to do it is via https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1792/nfts?token.id=0.0.15634&order=asc and look at the spender prop.

as a result if the failure is:

- association, then need to associate outside the contract in SDK
- transferNFT/FT, then you need to grant allowances to the contract explictly, then shift to using the allowance mechanisms. 
- mint an FT where a user wallet is the fee collector...refactor (leave contract as collector account then implement a payment splitter)

Funny thing I'll like to mention is that I was struggling with giving allowance to my smart contract because I was getting the INVALID_ALLOWANCE_SPENDER_ID error. Later on I figure that contract's AccountId should be passed as a string to the `AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction().approveTokenAllowance`  function and then everything works fine.

im just speculating here based on my limited knowledge, and would just like to know for my own understanding. i did notice that when copying a deployment script (that i used for a contract that minted a token in its constructor) to deploy another contract that is not payable nor calls any HTS methods that it failed with a CONTRACT_REVERT_EXECUTION and an error message of ""0x"" which wasn't helpful at all. once i removed the setInitialBalance it worked and it got me wondering why sending HBAR on top of the gas was necessary","",""

There is a max gas per (pseudo) block at 15mm. The hbar equivalent cost for a mint via HTS is above the hbar cost for 15mm in gas hence you need to use a payable method and pass hbar value. Using a simpler (read cheaper) HTS method like associate ($0.05) then it can simply pay with gas as is your intuition. Hope I have been coherent here - not this is from empirical experience playing with HTS via SDK and via Solidity for some time vs an official stance.","",""

First some background - I have a contract that is to act as a treasury that prior to the security model updates would call HTS.createFungibleToken and set itself as the treasury. Following the updates, I moved all HTS functions calls to a ""proxy"" contract that extended HTS as for things such as associating token, as we now need to delgatecall from the treasury contract to the ""proxy"" contract so that the EOA that is associating the token has their signature propagated to the HTS call

for some reason i keep getting INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE on Token Create in each of the following cases, despite writing the calls to send over 1000 HBAR with it. some code for reference in images (HTSProxy is the proxy contract directly calling HTS, LDCREToken is the treasury contract):

1. Payable constructor directly calling the proxy method (i thought this would be okay without delegatecall since the contract itself is acting as the treasury so it would make sense for the transaction signer to be the treasury contract) - here i do proxy.mintToken directly from the treasury contract's constructor, and i set the CreateContractTransaction to have setInitialBalance(new HBAR(1000)) and setMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(1000))

2. Using delegatecall and call to try calling the proxy method from the payable constructor (same as above but using delegatecall/call)

3. Having a method on the treasury contract that calls proxy.mintToken directly and with delegatecall/call (basically trying the two above but with a method separate from constructor). here i set setPayableAmount(new HBAR(1000)) and setMaxTransactionFee(new HBAR(1000)) on the ContractExecuteTransaction

i think i may be able to get around this by calling the proxy contract's mintToken from the hashgraph SDK after deploying both contracts and passing treasury contract address appropriately, but not sure why what im doing now wouldn't work","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909532351388864542/1097245622073036863/image.png,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/909532351388864542/1097245622337286225/image.png",""

i made these changes from the original logic prior to the security model updates where the EOA would try to execute a function in the former contract that called HTS.associateToken, but would fail with that invalid signature. i may be wrong about this but i was under the impression this was because after the security changes, the contract became the signer when calling HTS.associateToken rather than the EOA, so i added another contract on top that delegatecall to the one calling HTS.associateToken. please correct me if i'm wrong on this

I think the Gov Council pricing gas in USD$ terms ie pegging it.. averages from Fiat DEXs etc..  is an approach that needs a seriousness of mind re-evaluation by all the trouser wearing decision makers in the Farmhouse...  for the future.

Why?..  measuring  ledger 'Assets' value and 'usage' ie state changes/non mirror queries, in depreciating $ terms fails to reflect an accurate value of Ledger Assets(in HBAR-BTC terms) ..   

More accurate measure would be ..maybe.. re-evaluate the well-meaning approach (keeping gas 'price in $ terms low) via  multi-Dex  sourced Fiat pegging.. and simply price gas in deflating HBAR terms(ie value appreciation in $ terms -note-).. where gas 'price' 'setting' in HBAR terms would(should) be competed for and set by all the current nodes -  such a mechanism is probably not-compatible with core gossip-gossip.. or will add TPS overhead.

Gas 'bribes' for 'faster'  ie unfair transaction ordering - permits front-running is the Blockchain curse(not Hedera's) -  so perhaps pegging gas to HBAR-BTC  'ratio' of respective $ prices.. might be a mechanism of reflecting a more accurate 'value' of user(state change cost) of Assets on Hedera..  as opposed to a direct $ peg/average.

mind you... its still a Fiat 'priced' world mindset in the majority.. nodes pay their OpEx in Fiat.. whatever domicile etc..

I guess sounder-money yardsticks ie BTC measures of in-protocol 'values' is a ways in the future..

i just noticed today on hashscan that for a token like this, rather than 10,000.00000000 as the initial amount (ten thousand with 8 decimal places), it is now 1,000,000,000,000.00000000. so it has 10000 * 10^8 initial supply, AND 8 decimal places? this is extremely confusing

on my hashpack wallet, despite saying this on hashscan, it still says initial supply is 10,000 and the decimals are 8. and if do a token transfer of 21 tokens (or 21 * 10^8 to account for decimals), in hashscan it says i have 2,100,000,000.00000000 but on hashpack it still ""properly"" shows 21 tokens.

so which is correct and which should be the ""source of truth"" here? it should be hashscan i think but its also super super confusing that if what is on hashscan is correct, the entire system of how decimals are integrated into the token supply and value is completely different now. was there any announcement on this that I'm missing, could someone fill me in?

example: I have a smart contract that checks if the provided NFT is owned by the sender. it checks `IHTS.getNonFungibleTokenInfo(NFT_ID, NFT_SERIAL_ID)` and successfully returns the struct `IHTS.NonFungibleTokenInfo`

issue: I am issuing this call using an ECDSA account from portal.hedera.com with an account id of 0.0.156560. Inside the smart contract, `msg.sender` resolves to the evm address (`0x96be143b8e6bcf98996460e8d9be55463155ff07`) while the `IHTS.NonFungibleTokenInfo.ownerId` resolves to the 0-prefixed address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000026390`) and the smart contract's address comparator marks them as not equal

any insight to this?

1. token: 0.0.547740 (the calling account has 10 of these NFTs)
2. operator: the smart contract's address: 0.0.623029
3. approved: bool, set to true.

Funnily enough I tested the approveTokenNftAllowanceAllSerials in hedera js sdk and tried transferring NFTs from 0.0.548197 to some other account via that smart contract and it worked. What am I missing?

Basically, once you get the record with the signer, try something like:
`const tokenIdSolidityAddr = createTokenRx.contractFunctionResult.getAddress(0);`

2. Another way is to get the record, then do a record query with `TransactionRecordQuery` (https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/transactions/get-a-transaction-record), set `setIncludeChildren()` to `true` and then use the debugger to navigate the result (the token ID is somewhere in there)","",""
