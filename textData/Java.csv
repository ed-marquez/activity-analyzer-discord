Has anyone had any luck with the Hedera auction repo example (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-nft-auction-demo/) ? 

I cannot get the Java node to run!  I have matched requirements,  tried various versions of Java, Node and Gradle and its still failing to compile!

My errors https://pastebin.com/9pP2ttpF. Appreciate any help üôÇ","",""
