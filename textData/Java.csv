on the GitHub --> Hedera Java SDK documentation, it states: Transaction fees:
Transaction fees were set to 10 TinyBars, they are now 100,000 TinyBars.
Testnets are still allowing free transactions and queries, however a balance check is performed on the account funding the transaction or query.
If the balance is insufficient (e.g. less than 100,000 TinyBars), the operation will fail.

Should this statement be removed ? Testnets are still allowing free transactions and queries ?","",""

When a contract is created, a crypto account for the contract is created for it. Information about the account is available from `contractGetInfo`.
This is the account which is used by the smart contract to renew itself.

-If a contract is **payable**, you can fund its account with the **initialBalance** parameter of the `contractCreate` API. 
-If it **isn't payable**, you have to make a `cryptoTransfer` to that account to keep it funded, else the smart contract will expire automatically.
-The examples don't use payable contracts or transfer funds into that account, so they will expire after 1h.","","üëç (1)"

Is there currently a way in the Hedera SDK to create a Hedera file using a user's chrome/mobile wallet's private key to sign the transaction as the paying signature? Of course the private key must never leave the wallet, so I'm guessing my server app could provide a REST service method that returns the transaction body to the client via the public SDK's com.hedera.sdk.file.HederaFile.bodyToSignForCreate() method (which apparently also needs the paying account id, which maybe is not as sensitive and ""ok"" to pass to the server?), but the client code would then need to interact with the wallet to provide a signature for the transaction, correct? Once the signature is provided, the transaction still has to be submitted to the Hedera node, so what's the recommended way to do that then, pass it back to the server or should the client do that somehow? I'm guessing it's currently not possible to do this easily with the current state of the Hedera SDK / wallet APIs, correct? Do I simply need to wait for a later release of the SDK and the open-sourcing of the wallet software and dailytimestamp.com app to learn how to interact with the wallet? Any help is appreciated, thanks.","",""

If your app were to have a copy of the users' keys, it could interact directly with Hedera (requires compiling the necessary .proto) to generate a transaction body of the right type, and sign internally before sending, or, you could have an intermediate server as you mention which generates the TX, sends to the app, app returns a signature (using its locally stored keys) that the server then sends onto Hedera. The latter can be done with simple client/server comms. I'm not sure browsers/mobile os's/etc... have yet found a solution to this problem in a way that's seamless to the end user. I presume mobile app/browser apps would have to be able to request access to a specific key so that the user can authorise it before running, although how do you control the app doesn't use your keys to send itself coins whenever it wants ? Approve every TX ? Create an account per key that you keep a small amount of coins into... 
None of this is entirely solved with a mobile / web compliant SDK afaik.","",""

The Java SDK and probably all other ones incorporate objects to represent the private key / signature in context of transactions, but these SDKs are supposed to be used on the server side I guess. The private keys on the other hand should solely be kept on a client like browser (extension) or mobile app for security reasons. Is there a JS API like Web3 for Etherium to use Hedera directly from a client? If it is not the recommended way, how do you deal with this issue? How could a transaction be signed on the client, when all Java classes associated with it live on the server? I see questions about Cordova integration, which could wrap the Java SDK in a client. Should we wait for such solutions to come or is there  a good (meaning secure) way of doing things already now? Any info on recommended architecture patterns would be appreciated. Thanks a lot.

we don't have client-side SDKs yet unless you write your clients in Java/Go/RUST (some have been successful in creating android apps with the Java SDK as far as I know). 

The Java SDK examples focus on high level usage of the SDK methods to get you started, but those leverage lower level methods that enable you to construct a transaction server-side which could be passed to a client to sign. Once signed, the transaction can be passed from the client back to the server to send to the network.","",""

It's exactly how it should work, the server side is responsible for the process incl. the auditing, while the signing should be done externally, what ever the way the holder decided to manage his keys. Should the Hedera Wallet be an or the even the most important way to manage the trust , it would be great if Hedera would implement something in the SDK to ease such implementations however. 

I was already playing around with own key store services, and hated every moment investing into it. We try to avoid having to hold customers passwords ourselves these days, and now we are thinking about the ""right"" architecture to handle keys.

If you ask for it from a node that‚Äôs different to the one you submitted to and gossip hasn‚Äôt yet reached the node you query, it tells you the receipt is not found because it has not yet seen it.

Hedera doesn't keep transaction history for long, if you know the transactionID you can query for a receipt or record for that ID within 3 minutes of the transaction being submitted or so. After that time, the transactionID is no longer known by an of the nodes.
Unless that is, if the transaction had `generateRecord=true` then a record for that transaction will last 1hr and can be obtained using the `transactionID`.

Records are only created on accounts if either the account's `receiveThresholdRecord` was exceeded on receipt of a cryptoTransfer, or `sendThresholdRecord` was exceeded on sending hbar via a cryptoTransfer. Those records last 25h.

Until we have mirror nodes, once those receipts and records have been purged (3 min, 1h or 25h depending), there is no history of that transaction ever happening on Hedera.","",""

Having a client config of multiple nodes (all 4 test nodes), a file save operation behaves inconsistently. Sometimes it goes through but on other occasions it fails with a status code of ""OK"". 

From ResponseCodeEnum file
OK = 0; // The transaction passed the precheck validations.
This status isn't helping because no exception is thrown.

However with a single node client config, file save always goes through.

I'm using sdk v0.5.1.

Is there something I am missing or this is something Hedera team would be fixing soon. ü§î 

This is how I'm building Hedera client, as below:

private Client buildClient() {
        AccountId node1Id = hederaEnvProperties.buildNodeId(hederaEnvProperties.getNode1().getId());
        String node1Address = hederaEnvProperties.getNode1().getAddress();
        AccountId node2Id = hederaEnvProperties.buildNodeId(hederaEnvProperties.getNode2().getId());
        String node2Address = hederaEnvProperties.getNode2().getAddress();
        AccountId node3Id = hederaEnvProperties.buildNodeId(hederaEnvProperties.getNode3().getId());
        String node3Address = hederaEnvProperties.getNode3().getAddress();
        AccountId node4Id = hederaEnvProperties.buildNodeId(hederaEnvProperties.getNode4().getId());
        String node4Address = hederaEnvProperties.getNode4().getAddress();
//        return new Client(Map.of(node1Id, node1Address, node2Id, node2Address, node3Id, node3Address, node4Id, node4Address));
        return new Client(Map.of(node1Id, node1Address));

This upgrade includes a transition to dynamic transaction and query fees, which are calculated via a public and regularly updated schedule. This is reflective of how the Hedera mainnet will function. Hedera is developing pricing tools (coming soon), which will help make estimating fees quick and easy.

Please ensure your data is preserved prior to the upgrade ‚Äî all smart contract and file data will need to be restored. Depending on your application's testnet configuration, you may also need to increase the maximum fee amount of your API calls to prevent breaking changes.

You can find the new testnet fees (beta) information in our official Hedera documentation.

And the transaction of creating the file is not enough, since a third party won't have access to that transaction (after a day or more)","",""

With transactions, the network will only charge the actual amount needed, so you won't pay that amount. If you specify too low an amount for the transaction, you will get `INSUFFICIENT_TX_FEE`.
Getting a record and printing the `record.getTransactionFee()` will tell you how much the transaction actually cost.","",""
"429323958592995328","Greg Scullard#5365","09/07/2019 10:15 AM","The same can be done with Queries, below is an example for a `contractCallQuery`, but it works the same for all types of queries.

```
        long estimatedCallCost = new ContractCallQuery(client)

Note: I have put an estimate for the gas at 30,000. When the requestCost() query is run, the contract itself isn't executed but assuming that is sufficient, you will get the query cost in return.
Likewise, I've specified `100_000_000` for the query fee I'm willing to pay. Contrary to transactions, that fee (and gas) will be entirely consumed when you run the actual query so it pays to get that fee right.

In this example (Taken from the Simple Contract sdk example), the returned query cost is : 239199

I used this result (+ 5% for good measure) as an input to the actual query:

```
        estimatedCallCost = estimatedCallCost + (estimatedCallCost / 20);
        FunctionResult contractCallResult = new ContractCallQuery(client)

But in the hedera sdk (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-java/tree/master/src/main/java/com/hedera/hashgraph/sdk/contract), I only see `ContratCallQuery` which based on fees is the former.
Any ideas on how to invoke the ""local"" one?","",""

@crypt1c  It should just be a case of you compiling your Solidity using solc and then uploading the resulting binary to the Hedera public filesystem.

apologies, should have been clearer that I meant without the fiat peg. Without the peg if a transfer was set at a specific amount of tinybar (lets say 100k), effectively you get 1000 transfers per HBAR, its then simple function of whatever the exchange rate might be on a particular given day whether you get 10 HBAR (or whatever theoretical token instead) to the dollar, or you get 1 or even .1 that dictate how many transfers you will be able to make

Now granted price will be much more variable at this early stage (even though it seems to be settling atm) and in general should become more stable in the future, even buying monthly there is still a risk of fluctuations even in that short a time frame. So then you have to ask the questions of what happens? Does the person buying your services get more / less service for their HBARs? Do the people you then pass those HBARs onto get more / less? As a company are we expected to fill the gap? Is the inverse of us as a company pocketing any extra profits fair? Is it all just a case of ""what you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts"" and over time it _should_ even out? (not expecting answers btw, these are just some of the conversations we have in the office)

also @Johnda98 I appreciate that currency risks are still present in the fiat world whatever currency you use (I'm UK based so things have gotten more expensive post the Brexit vote, but someone from Venezuela for example would argue we got off lightly).

Ok, so 
`TransactionId txId = new TransactionId(operatorId)`
will give you a transaction ID
which you can then provide to your `ContractCreateTransaction` transaction
`.setTransactionId(txId)`
Put a try/catch around the transaction call, and on the error, see example below
```
        TransactionId txId = new TransactionId(ExampleHelper.getOperatorId());
        // create the contract itself

It may be an issue when you have multiple calls in quick succession to hedera, and the subsequent calls might not get triggered because the initial channel was not closed.","",""

Unlike etheruem (which has unlimited state size), in hedera everything is perishable/""delete-able"". This means that the state of a contract has to be stored together. In ethereum, because a state can't be deleted, state from a contract is stored in different regions across the merkle tree. But here, hedera needs to pre-allocate  a certain size limit (kinda like how linked list stores node anywhere, whereas an array has to store everything in one place).
It also turns out that the state size limit on smart contracts is inversely proportional to the tps on the contract (as @Johnda98  pointed out).

No, the sdk has no implementation of `.fromSolidityAddress()` that takes in byte[] as a param. Instead,  I manually converted byte to string using this:
```//convert bytearray to hex string.

        char[] hexChars = new char[bytes.length * 2];
        for (int j = 0; j < bytes.length; j++) {
            int v = bytes[j] & 0xFF;

            hexChars[j * 2 + 1] = HEX_ARRAY[v & 0x0F];

"624672916373766184","Hua#7134","02/02/2020 4:54 PM","@Greg Scullard I'm reporting a bug in the latest Hedera Java SDK, which I have just created an issue: Incorrect parameter encoding for solidity address in latest Hedera Java SDK at https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/issues/520 The details is here: I have discovered a potential bug in the Hedera Java SDK. This bug is related to solidity address encoding. I was working with a solidity contract its constructor has an address as argument. The contract was deployed on testnet with success. However, contract calls that reference that address failed. Based on my analysis, the root cause is the incorrect padding in the method com.hedera.hashgraph.sdk.contract.ContractFunctionParams.addAddress(String). To my knowledge, this bug has not been reported in https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/issues nor in https://discordapp.com/invite/FFb9YFX

Bug details:
The account in question is ""0.0.155271"" and it's 20 byte solidity address in hex form is:
String addressInHex = ""0000000000000000000000000000000000025e87"";

I used the following code to create the contract:
TransactionId contractTxId = new ContractCreateTransaction()
.setBytecodeFileId(newFileId)
.setGas(100_000_000)
.setConstructorParams(
new ContractFunctionParams()
.addAddress(addressInHex))
.execute(client);

The constructor parameter (32 bytes, 64 hex characters) encoded with the following sdk method: com.hedera.hashgraph.sdk.contract.ContractFunctionParams.addAddress(String) in hex is:
0000000000000000000000000000000000025e87000000000000000000000000

which is incorrect due to padding to the right. The correct encoding (with left-hand side padding) should be:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000025e87

In my test, when I did custom encoding with left-hand side padding, the same contract calls after contract deployment succeeded.","",""

The type of the secret key is AppNet specific, however it is recommended to use a minimum of 256 bit secrets. The example plugin provides generateSecretKey() to generate 256 bit AES secrets

The encryption scheme that HCS SCX uses is plugin based and users can define their own by implementing the SxcMessageEncryption interface. The example Cryptopgraphy plugin implements AES/GCM/NoPadding encryption and uses 32 byte private keys. Encryption can either be static where the same key is used throughout the life time of a communicating pair or rotating; optionally, the application can use a plugin based key rotation scheme and the example plugin implements Diffie Hellmann key exchange (DHKE). Notice that when key rotation is enabled then the initial secret generated by generateSecretKey() is replaced by the shared secret that is generated by the key rotation implementation; however, encryption remains to be AES. Thus, the symmetric key is used until rotation is triggered. This is permissible because the AES standard does not specify a structure on the key used, but it is important too ensure that the size of the key generated they key rotation scheme is the same as the size required by the encryption plugin.","","üëç (3)"

When the nodes see a transaction, they measure it, ie they determine how many bytes on the wire it used, how many signatures it has that require verification, how long a storage burden (in RAM or disk) it will impose, and , if a contract create/call, how much gas it uses. Nodes compare this calculated size/burden/usage to whether the tx was submitted with sufficient gas & fee to pay for this usage. We mostly measure gas based on the Ethereum opcodes but, for the opcodes that imply a storage burden , we replace the static gas value with an amount of gas that reflects the storage duration. Ultimately nodes end up with an assessment of how much bandwidth, RAM, disk, gas, signatures each ContractCall uses, and multiplies each of those values by a corresponding price in cents/X or cents/X/hour. Those products are added up, and then converted to tinybars for the actual fee.

I suggest it is studied on how generic ETH wallets can send ETH to an SC and how the wallet transaction pays for the ETH xfer to the contract(SC).   Firstly the whole point of a SC is that it is more trusting for a wallet to send to a contract than to trust a DApps public function to xfer ie for a platforms account to pay for a xfer from an account that the user has to deposit to.   This is the whole purpose of a contract.. It holds the cryoto not a platform accnt that it holds the keys to.     This is what you are suggesting with a call to Contractexecutetransaction... Remember the whole point of a DEX is that anonymous wallets can deposit.. Ie wallets pays the sign fees..to send to a SC that they trust (verified etc) with a fallback that is triggered by the wallets deposit and thus the msg.sender & msg.value are safe in the SC.","","üëç (1)"

Why is this so?  Because..  The dapp because its a DEX ..does not keep any  account, encrypted pkeys or email or any kyc signup info...  Nor does a dex ask for anyones pkeys..

The reason crypto transfer was not allowed  and you had to use contractCallMethod  with empty functionParameters  and non zero amount was exactly that if you did not want your contract to be payable it would not accept any hbar. If you designed your contract to be payable you also probably provisioned methods to withdraw balance or self destruct . Now, if you by mistake transfer hbar to contract and it was not designed as payable there is no way to withdraw contract balance. Another issue as you can see is there is no way to port some deFi contracts from ethereum to HH  because if contract ""receives"" hbar as a result of crypto transfer transaction its callback function would not be called.  Could you please find out if this is by design or just a new loophole ?

I have been trying to figure out what is the best way to create a client in mainnet. Client.forMainnet() is a bad idea because it will include nodes that might have partial outage and it doesn't include the latest nodes (0.0.13, 0.0.14, 0.0.15).

My current thinking is:
```
Pass all nodes in .env
Map<String, AccountId> goodNodes = {};

for each node:
   create a client with just that node
   client.ping(nodeId)
   if this doesn't throw an error, add to a goodNodes map.
```

Haven't tried this yet, but do you think this is a good idea?  I assume client.ping() would throw an error if the node is out.

I can tweak the `Client` and `TransferTransaction` max fees with no change, the only thing I can change to make it go away is to increase the initial balance for account `0.0.411527`

is it expected that initializing a testnet account with `100_000_000` tinys will cause this, but 10x that amount (`1_000_000_000`) won't?

Say you have a function that contains a loop that starts with 2 iterations and grows to 200 over time. The gas necessary to run two loops will necessarily be lower than for 200 loops...

Think of storage and instructions within your contract as the equivalent as miles covered in a car, the more storage and instructions you run, the more miles you cover and therefore the more gas you need.

I've been playing with some small java apps to get used to the SDK and I was wondering if someone could sanity check this with me.  I'm trying to programmatically show some of the fees expected for some actions and saw a reference to the Fee Schedule file (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-java/issues/144#issuecomment-508098694).  I assumed it'd be a representation of the fees page (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/mainnet/fees) describing the kinds of transactions and the price in hbar or dollars or something.

Unlike the ExchangeRateSet special file, there doesn't seem to be a class in the .sdk package to convert it into, only the protobuf itself. On testnet, if download the file, stuff it into a protobuf, and show it contents it looks empty:
```java
ByteString contents = new FileContentsQuery()
                    .setFileId(FileId.FEE_SCHEDULE)
                    .execute(client);

FeeSchedule currFeeSchedule = FeeSchedule.fromBytes(contents.toByteArray());
System.out.println(currFeeSchedule);
```
shows:
```
FeeSchedule{transactionFeeSchedules=[TransactionFeeSchedule{requestType=NONE, feeData=FeeData{nodeData=null, networkData=null, serviceData=null, type=DEFAULT}, fees=[]}], expirationTime=1970-01-01T00:00:00Z}

Now I want to associate one of these account IDs to the other private key so both IDs are associated to only one private key (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/hedera-api/cryptocurrency-accounts/cryptoupdate) As of today I found no wallet supporting this feature so I want to code a tool myself even I am just a SI I think I can tackle it and learn something along the way. Coding for Hedera is a first timer for me and I am currently looking at the the ""Environment Set-up"" documentation (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/environment-set-up) where you can choose between Java, JavaScript & Go. What would you recommend and why isn't there rust, python, c & dotnet to choose from as we have channels for these languages in discord? I have a double boot system with Linux & Windows, any recommendation on what to use to code on for better support in the future? Is it even relevant? For example I just see windows terminal commands in the environment set-up documentation, no Linux.

- Compiling in Remix will give you a JSON file that looks something like the image (imagine the file is named HelloHedera.json).
- Once you have that in your project directory, then you need ""object"", which is the bytecode
- In Java, you can get ""object"" from the JSON, as follows:

 //Import the compiled contract from the HelloHedera.json file
Gson gson = new Gson();
JsonObject jsonObject;

InputStream jsonStream = HelloHederaSmartContract.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(""HelloHedera.json"");
jsonObject = gson.fromJson(new InputStreamReader(jsonStream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8), JsonObject.class);

//Store the ""object"" field from the HelloHedera.json file as hex-encoded bytecode
String object = jsonObject.getAsJsonObject(""data"").getAsJsonObject(""bytecode"").get(""object"").getAsString();

The Tech Stack I am using (Spring Boot, PostgresQL , Hedera Java SDK,  Hedera Mirror Node  for querying the transactions and, Testnet for playing around with transactions)

Q1. How to associate account id with a Real world user, As I cannot store user name or any other identity in the Hedera Node, So How to identify that a specific account id corresponds to a specific user?

Q2. In one of my use case I need 3 account holders to sign the transaction so that One account can transfer his hbars/tokens from his account to another account, How to achieve it using Multi Sig, as all I have is account Id's of the users and not the private keys. How are the are the associated signers notified about the transaction? I did'nt find any proper documentation around it.

Q3. What is the difference between executing a transaction and freezing a transaction? Can the executed transaction be tampered as it is not freezed?

Q4. While working with HTS, Can we use the same Operator_Key as (Admin Key, Freeze Key, KYC Key and Supply Key) as the Operator is the entity which has all the admin rights to work with the token?

Q5. Is it suggested to store the private key on an external db so that I can get the associated public key to work with HTS? If it is not suggested can you please let me know the suggested approach.

Thanks in advance.","",""

"976160480534077490","Francesco Coacci#2822","06/03/2022 1:32 PM","Hi, first of all there are two ways to create a fungible token. One using SDK and one using Solidity Contract. You can choose between this two based on what you need.

Q1. If you mean like linking in some way a user to his account id in Postgres, I think you can make a user connect his wallet to your dApp. After that you can store an account id and the infos your user will give you (name, username).

Q2. You need to make everyone sign your transaction using a Private Key, to do that you'll need to send every account your transaction by using a `.toBytes()` extension method. You can check out the process from this old answer: https://discord.com/channels/373889138199494658/768621337865486347/935470314148741190

Q3. Freezing a transaction means you are avoiding any edit on it before executing. After you freeze a transaction you need to sign it with your private key or multiple private keys. When you use the `.execute(client)` method, you are actually signing your transaction with the operator. Also, when you call execute, your transaction will be submitted to the network.

Q4. Actually when you create the token you can set all different keys, the operator is just the one responsible for paying transaction fees. But it's all up to you, you can make your operator as supply key, admin key, etc. or just a payer with no ownership.

Q5. It's better NOT to store private keys anywhere. I'm using a .env file just for the operator key and account id but I'm not sure if it's good for production purposes. Maybe @Ed Marquez or @Greg Scullard  know some best practices on storing one.

Btw check out this repo even if I'm using Javascript SDK to see how to create an NFT (quite similar to an FT) using a Solidity Contract instead of the SDK directly. Note that in this example, the contract itself is the supplyKey and treasury of the token created, also there is no admin key.

I am calling a function from a smart contract created beforehand:

> ContractCallQuery query = new ContractCallQuery()
>                     .setContractId(ContractId.fromString(request.getContractID()))
>                     .setGas(100_000_000)
>                     .setFunction(request.getContractFunctionName(), contractFunctionParameters);
> 
> 
> ContractFunctionResult contractCallResult = query.execute(hederaClient);

The hedera client is initialized as such:

> hederaClient = Client.forName(""testnet"");
> hederaClient.setOperator(AccountId.fromString(secretsManagerSecret.get(""hedera.operator.id"").toString(), PrivateKey.fromString(secretsManagerSecret.get(""hedera.operator.key"").toString());
> hederaClient.setDefaultMaxTransactionFee(new Hbar(10_000));
>         hederaClient.setDefaultMaxQueryPayment(new Hbar(10_000));
>         hederaClient.setMaxAttempts(1000);
