regarding most number of transactions in `TransferTransaction`
So it isn't limited by the payload. 

As soon as there are more than 10 unique from or to addresses, it throws an error: `TOKEN_TRANSFER_LIST_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

The good news is though, you can even have 100 separate `.addTokenTransfer()` as long as the to addresses repeat! (I guess only then it is limited by the payload size. Even then the Java SDK does a good job of combining the same addresses together).","",""

Any reason why a token couldn't or wouldn't be denominated as a liability ?
eg an account A agrees to accept debt token D from vendor V
ie A says to V ""bill me in D and we'll settle in due course""
A settles by sending V a tx of D+hbar for example

Of course enforcement is not trustless, but with public auditable tx then agreed logic might be tied to ts&cs and/ or ratings","",""

Any number of instances of an application can subscribe to a topic and receives all the messages in the correct sequence.
This means you can easily keep applications completely synchronised, catch up if you've been offline, all with the benefit of Hedera's consensus algorithm but without running it yourself.

Hopefully by the end of the hackathon I can have clearer requests/suggestions/ideas for HTS.

`TokenMint` is another method where you can mint an additional supply, so if you wanted to mint another 100 YezzerCoins to support your business logic you would call this method, but it doesnt matter whether you want to mint 100 or 100,000,000, the fee is the same.

For NFTs, depending on how many you want to issue and how actively they would be traded, you may be better looking at a HCS implementation, as not only is the issuance of each NFT relatively expensive (for an in-game item, fairly expensive.... for a piece of art or the title deed to a house, not so much), there are also considerations around each account needing to associate with the different tokens. For example, if I wanted to swap my Yezzer-NFT-A for your Yezzer-NFT-B, we would both need to associate with both tokens (and optionally dissociate from them later).

I have small newbie problem with ed25519 Private key

I tried digging up in Maven repository for this key and found such Java scheme in cafe.cryptography although sadly it didnt have fromString method.
Only those which i prompted on screenshot.

- proxy-staking (staking your HBAR / votes to a node for a share of the revenue they earn for processing transactions - with no risk of slashing / punishment if the node is malicious)
- operating a node (if you operate a node and convince people to submit their transactions to you then you would be able to keep a higher portion of the transaction fees generated by those transactions)

Once its on the network, your friend will be able to check it (to make sure you haven't been sneaky and tried to take all of their tokens), sign it and submit the now fully signed transaction to the network where it will execute and all of the swaps take place.

unfortunately there isnt a built in order book / exchange, so if you didn't already have a buyer you would have to look at other methods (either token transfers on supported exchanges, using wrapped tokens, etc, etc)

To fractionalize the NFT though, I'd probably need a smart contract and fungible Tokens that represent the interest in the NFT itself, as the NFT should probably be indivisible as the underlying asset. Do you see a way of fractionalizing NFTs with HTS?","",""

As  more community HIP standards and recommendations come out of the ether over the coming months hopefully things will be less opaque.","","üëç (2)"

The exchanges which definitely support HBAR are listed on the Hedera website others may too.
As for Binance, you can imagine that they do not suffer from a lack of coins wanting to get listed on it, so they are very choosy and expensive. You have to have both the project which is of interest to them and enough money to pay the listing fee. There were cases when they took new not release projects, but they had significant financial backing. From what I see they favour projects running on BSC and currently they take mostly NFT projects to increase their footprint in this area. Coins such as Alice and TLM are both very new Alice game is going to be released only at the end of the year. But they both raised good money from their public and private sales. For the less well-funded projects, they have BSCPad which does not automatically lead to listing but gives a good headstart nonetheless.

On mainnet, you can use one of many wallet applications to create an account, use an exchange to fund the account with hbar and then issue transactions to the Hedera mainnet using that account.","",""

Is there a better pattern for tokenizing NFT‚Äôs than creating a Token class with a single Token for each NFT?  Seems using Tokens within a Token Class would make more sense.  Is that do-able or are there gotcha‚Äôs going that route?

WHAT IS AN NFT?
An NFT is a unique token living on a blockchain that represents (or points to) some other data, like an image or video. Because they live on a blockchain, NFTs are easy to track. This tracking allows for verification of their authenticity as well as their past history and owners. 
Formally, NFTs are smart contracts that people interact with by calling them and then receiving proof of interaction.

Every token type has an associated account (the treasury account). An expired account that can‚Äôt autorenew is deactivated for a week. If it still hasn‚Äôt been renewed, it is deleted, and its tokens transfer to the treasury account. 

The treasury account always has an expiration date the same as or later than its TokenType. (Extending the latter automatically extends the former, if needed).  So the treasury account can‚Äôt expire unless the TokenType itself expires. In which case, all tokens of that type expire.
By the way, anyone can, at any time, extend the life of the TokenType. Or of a file or smart contract or topic. So if a community is relying on a given entity continuing to exist, any member of that community can make sure it does.","",""

So, HTS can be used to create and transfer tokens. Let's say for the sake of simplicity that would be an NFT token, which is unique and can only be minted once. Say you put it on site, and 2 people are trying to buy it around the same time. How do you deal with the following:

a) Where the payment transaction would be sent - to the ""token"" address or to a specific dedicated address?
b) If it's not the ""token address"" - how to understand that the transfer done by the ""customers"" is for that item specifically (memo on the transaction?) 
c) When the first transaction comes in and you ""transfer"" the token - what happens to the latter transaction - will it be automatically refunded (if it was sent to the ""token"" address for example) or it would need to be handled in some specific way?","",""

a) the payment in hbar could be included in the same transaction as the token transfer, the token holder and the payer would both have to sign the transaction, either be exchanging transaction payloads with each other so they can both sign and one submit to Hedera, or using a scheduled transaction, the buyer submits the transaction as a scheduled transaction, shares the transaction id with the seller who can query for the transaction, verify he/she's happy with it and submit his/her signature for the scheduled transaction to execute. This has to happen within 30 minutes or the transaction is discarded by the network.
b) if you separate the token transfer from payment via a third party, the memo could indeed be used to indicate the reason for the payment.
c) the latter transaction would not be refunded no, but if two transactions per the a) solution were sent, the first to execute will succeed, the second will fail since the seller no longer holds a token to transfer to a buyer (INSUFFICIENT TOKEN BALANCE would be the error)","",""

But think of ordinary users and how that makes the whole journey worse for them. Imagine those native tokens and the user A who wants to gift some custom token to user B (user B is your regular internet user, whose only knowledge about crypto, let alone Hedera, is summed up to ""it exists""). Now you immediately have a few obstacles:
a) The user B needs to have a wallet (that is solvable and Hedera lists a number of wallets, so OK on this front).
b) The user B needs to associate the token to its account - already not very straightforward and you might not find Android/iOS wallets supporting that (and don't forget the wallet should also be able to display those native tokens).
c) The user B has no idea that even if wallet was downloaded and tokens are received, in 3 months + a week or two of the grace period, unless there is some top up with hBars, his account will be gone and all his gifted/purchased items will be gone. That's the worst part of it and rather sneaky/non-obvious for a ""normal"" user. And by the way, this might pose a legal problem if the tokens were purchased and then due to this ""expiration"" most users would not know about, they would go back to treasury/seller - this is similar to you buying an item (let's say a new sofa) and next day seller coming to your house and saying ""I've heard you haven't paid the rent this month, so you might be moving out soon, and I'm taking the sofa back (but you won't get a refund)""","",""

Actually, it is not. This is no different than when people put things away in a storage unit and doesn't pay the lease. Having a ""rent"" model or if you prefer, subscription as a service, is actually extremely common; companies in the real world are incentives to keep your things in good state. Without a subscription as a service, you risk bankruptcy due to exponential cost. I guarantee no ledger will store for free without eventually running into an hidden fee model or shutting down your ""lease"" due to running out of currency.

Free is not possible without serious consequences and the fact that Hedera is transparent about this is good for all of us. Without a fee model, no ledger is incentives to keep your token. In the case of Ethereum, the fee is several hundred dollars to create one while Hedera is only $1. (So just consider doing $1 + 10 cents and still walk away with extremely low cost)","",""

You do NOT have an option to move native Hedera tokens out of Hedera. And your stuff is not geting sent from the storage to whoever sold it to you years ago. My point is not that the storage should not be ""supported"", but that the model chosen to support it is bad. It would be more straightforward to require a non-spendable amount of 1 (tiny) Hbar to be always present for example, rather than allow you to seemingly work fine with the wallet and then 3 months later suddenly take your stuff and remove it. Or just leave the account having custom tokens be - it won't be possible to move the assets without hbars, but at least the assets will be still there, eliminating the whole potential legal issue of the assets being taken away. And considering that they would still be referenced by the treasury, I would imagine that is not a tremendous amount of storage that the network can't compensate in other ways.","",""

What you are talking about is the relationship between you and Hedera in your comparison to using AWS. Not the relationship between _you and your client_. Now imagine that you use AWS to sell services or items. You have customers. They believe they have ""bought"" your services or items and they are blissfully unaware that in 3 months they would have to _pay to AWS_ so the services they ""bought"" from you don't disappear and the items they bought from you are not returned to you (without a refund). I hope it is a bit clearer now.

If the comparison you provided was in response to the point about the tokens to support, rather than accounts expiration subject, then yes, you have a point. However, there is still a problem - the costs of supporting multitude of tokenized objects, if your margin is low, are not sustainable in the long run for a small business or solo entrepreneur. Not just that - if your business happens to stop doing what it was doing (or if you just lost interest), all your clients are going to lose their assets (now imagine some expensive NFT there or something).","",""

The general idea would be to have a ""bundle"" or ""atomic"" transaction type which could carry two or more transactions, an order would be specified for these transactions such that when the bundle reaches consensus, the transactions are executed in the specified order and if any fails, the entire bundle fails.

So the bundle would essentially contain an array of transactions, not sure if each transaction would carry its own signatures, or whether the bundle would (I think signatures per bundle would make more sense, since they approve the entire ""process"" and could be supported by scheduled transactions too).

Such bundles could:
-Create a token, associate to an account, transfer the token

However, the crux of the matter is that users can surely intentionally or mistakenly empty their HBARs and lose their account. What happens if I'm holding $10k of a stablecoin, but HBARs became 0. To be really honest, my first impression of reading your response, you're simply giving reasons in defense of the current design. I don't want to turn this into a debate, but a short response: 9 cents over 100 years can not honestly be thought of as an economical incentive. These fees cause more headaches than any possible benefit.

I understand this is the current design, and it's unlikely to change. As a consequence of Hedera imposing these fees, architects and developers deserve a deeper level of details in the form of a white paper, a medium blog, or thorough documentation that explains from Hedera's point of view how accounts should be managed over time. Some example topics / questions:
 - if an account is closed, how do we reopen it after the expiration period?
 - if an account is closed, and another party had sent us funds at the closed account, are the funds lost?
 - since there is a get balance fee, explicitly point out to developers they need to implementing rate limiting on their side, otherwise the operator's wallet can be drained, causing an account closure, thereby causing a full denial of service.
 - documentation that clearly explains what happens to token balances once HBAR hits 0. i.e. the tokens are lost too?
 - explicitly pointing out to developers and providing best practices of how to manage long lived wallets. i.e. a ""hosted"" consumer wallet where the consumer who is not a developer may drain the wallet, and how should developers protect and manage these wallets so they aren't closed.
 - Should the developers force an arbitrary minimum balance of 1 HBAR, etc...","",""

An account that is no longer active cannot receive funds. Can't accidentally send funds to it.
Since renewal fees hasn't been enabled yet, you won't see an example of what happens. Furthermore, I expect renewal fees to be live at the same time as proxy staking, further offsetting the cost if any HBAR in the wallet if staking used.

""Hedera imposing these fees"", is not the proper terminology. Hedera is saying this is how much it cost to do ""this"" and ""that"" on the network and charges its users for such services. There isn't a network or service that is truly free, there is always a catch 22. Hedera is being transparent about the cost. One option is to increase the cost for the first token create to allow for that minimum deposit of HBAR. You'll also notice there's a #üíª-hips channel for such suggestion. I recommend checking out the pinned link if you wish to contribute to the solution.

Honestly and IMHO, the issue is being nitpicked. There is a higher chance of someone losing their private key than a Developer forgetting to leave a balance on the account. üßê","","üëç (2)"

When an account runs out of hbar, it will be marked for deletion and can be funded again for a short period of time (TBD) so it ""undeletes"" itself and renews automatically. If not funded within that time, it will be deleted and removed from the ledger, no funds can be sent to it after then, and the account id cannot be reused.

 - if an account is closed, and another party had sent us funds at the closed account, are the funds lost?

See above, the transaction will fail and funds will not leave the paying account.

 - since there is a get balance fee, explicitly point out to developers they need to implementing rate limiting on their side, otherwise the operator's wallet can be drained, causing an account closure, thereby causing a full denial of service.

getBalance is free as is getReceipt, no need to rate limit this.

 - documentation that clearly explains what happens to token balances once HBAR hits 0. i.e. the tokens are lost too?

per current design tokens left in an account with 0 hbar will be transferred back to the token's treasury at the time the account is deleted.

Planning to open source building of DONDA Distributed this weekend, which is a consortium of six vertically integrated crypto brands: identity and reputation system, bank, commodity market, commerce market, fashion house, media network, social network.

Ive built out demo frontends for most of the apps, and have a whitepaper written, but wanted to build a signup form that posts a public transaction to Mainnet with [valueAdd] - [pseudonym] - [twitter@] to a wallet as a way of demoing Hedera. It‚Äôs also great for social proof / momentum building (used this strategy when creating https://www.worldartday2021.com as a 100+ artist NFT fundraiser for Creative Commons).

I have the frontend for the form built out but just need a simple endpoint that takes [memo] from a private DB and POSTs a wallet transaction.

Think this will be the ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment that convinces my friends who are founders in fintech/ecommerce/saas and early employees at CashApp/Shopify/Sequoia Capital to go all in on Hedera. They‚Äôre ETH inclined at the moment since they don‚Äôt know better üòõ Also recruiting my ETH rich friends to move some money over and the artists over at Tezos (biggest NFT platform Hic et Nunc) to migrate. Will eventually tokenize my $2m+ fashion brand (ismbags.com) on HTS and distribute tokens to our 10k customers.

Would anyone be down to help create that endpoint and/or be involved in DD as an early builder?

He said that Hederas tokenizing service was aimed at larger institutions and was probably about two years behind for smaller retail adaptation.

What is the reason for the 3 month renewal of NFTs? So is he saying that if the content creator doesnt renew the people who purchased the NFT will lose what they purchased?

BUT as soon as last signature attached transaction completes with  TOKEN_ID_REPEATED_IN_TOKEN_LIST. To exclude wrong data for transaction the same data (absolutely identic completes with success if it's executed in reqular way: if it's generated, signed within 120-180 seconds). Also scheduled transaction easily could be found in scheduled transaction with all attached signatures.

It's possible an orange ball has a higher value than a red one for example, so you need to be able to specify that you're transferring the orange one, not the red one when you do and that's where the serial number comes in.

This is a normalized snippet of our final JSON we're using. image and description format matches ERC-721 for interoperability with wallets /markets that  already display ERC-721 correctly. 

We don't use token symbol field in the shcema but it's set on Hedera network as the IPFS key. Token ID is an interesting idea, though you will have that information to grab this info I believe. So a wallet is connected and you see all the token IDs, then you pull the token info from that id. I don't know when you'd have the schema and not have the id in practice.

That's interesting, for the usecase in IPFS I understood it to be 1 GUID would use the IPFS network to pull the shards from anywhere its being called to the local nodes and serve the file to the client. But sounds like there's different schemas based on locale.

So with NFTs, this would be possibly less of an issue, except for the standard it'd be good to maintain the ability for non digital art NFTs to have that local injection for the different schema locations.

Unless when minting we build a schema per language and they're being uploaded to IPFS and added to the token, making sure all the locale IPFS ids to be present for each of the languages.

Token transfers are atomic, so there could be an exchange of hbar and a few other fungible tokens for the NFT - that's no problem. Since royalty fees are basically ""fractional fees for NFTs"" I'm thinking that the fee is just a **percentage of the total value exchanged in the end**.

Let's imagine:
- User A sends user B an NFT X (with a custom royalty fee of 10%)
- User B sends User A 3 fungible tokens + some h bar in exchange for the NFT X

**Answer:**
- The 10% fee is deducted from all fungible value that A receives in the transaction (both units of fungible tokens and ‚Ñè). There is an example transaction record in the HIP 18 page that you linked : )

- This rule still applies even if A sends the NFT to B, and **only a third party C **transfers fungible value to A in the CryptoTransfer. That is, the royalty is collected from ALL fungible value received by the party sending the NFT in a transaction.","",""

Maybe that introduces an interesting dynamic... to bypass the % royalty, and use the fallback instead, but still have a trustless exchange of FT value, the atomic transaction could include party D to receive the funds:

A --- NFT ---> B
D <--- FT --- C

Similar to fractional fees, would there then also need to be a min/max option, otherwise  A/B can simply exchange a tiny FT amount to avoid even the fallback, whilst sending the ""real"" value via C/D

That's because  much of the perceived value of NFTs (or art in general) comes from the public purchase history. If the records show Bob's NFT only cost 1 tinybar, the re-seller would most likely have a very hard time trying to flip it for 1000USDC on the ledger.

Yes, there is standard (HIP-10: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-10.md#abstract). It's not a requirement in the sense that you could create a token which doesn't conform to it. But the point of the schema is to provide a standard way to query HTS NFTs.

Note that many accounts can associate with a token. In fact with NFTs, you associate with the `TokenId`, not each individual NFT, so if there are 100 NFTs for a given `TokenId`, more than one account has to be able to associate with the `TokenId`.
Association only means `the account holder accepts to receive a token`, it doesn't transfer any tokens.","",""

I have a question about minting a token after the initial token creation and intiial mint. 

Essentially we are creating 8,192 NFTs in all. Right now I have Turtle Moon Tools working where you can point to the two folders holding your hashlips export images and json, and it'll auto upload all the images to IPFS, add that CID into the metadata, upload that metadata to IPFS, then mint that onto a token, all on one token ID.

The issue:
We have many custom packs and will need to auto generate 100 at a time to accommodate the art. I have a supply key I place on the token, and the token has a max supply of 8,192.

Question:
What do I need to do with the supply key so that I can continually mint on the same token ID? I'm getting invalid signature now and I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong.

That does make sense for sure as I bet the data size growth of the other chains will inevitably need to be addressed as you mentioned.  So far there are opportunities for less tech savvy individuals to own NFTs and hold Tokens, etc. on other chains indirectly.  With this model I think the initial hurdle is going to be normalizing the notion of ""maintenance fees"" when someone purchases and holds any Hedera assets through a third party.  The unknown is likely the thing to give the most friction so hopefully the process of setting these fees will be very transparent and changes will follow a schedule that is likely pretty long.  If the fees are negligibly low that overhead could likely be absorbed indirectly by the service provider.  I'm interested in potentially using Hedera for games in the future and other applications.","",""

Furthermore, I want tokens to only be minted by a prosumer when they produce electricity, and tokens to be wiped from the total circulating supply when electricity is consumed. This way we ensure that at any given moment, the total circulating supply of the energy tokens is proportional to the total circulating amount of electricity in kWh on the network. 
To answer your questions, 
- Yes the fungible tokens can be said to be some sort of pre-established currency

If Bob had separately paid Alice, Hedera has no way to calculate the percentage payment since the payment was done outside of the token transfer.

If it's a fixed royalty (not a percentage of transfer value), e.g. 1hbar, then Bob still has to sign the transaction since he's paying the 1hbar to Carol when Alice transfers the token to him.

The ledger cannot approve a transaction including a payment from Bob without his signature in other words.","",""

You could test the behavior yourself with this example: https://github.com/ed-marquez/hedera-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/hts-nftP3-pause-freeze-wipe-delete.js
Just comment out the code section that wipes Alice's account, and add this code at the end to the dissociate the token and Alice's account: 

    let tokenDissociateTx = await new TokenDissociateTransaction()
        .setTokenIds([tokenId])

"251863221651111937","Ashe Oro#8558","01/18/2022 10:07 AM","typically the best practice regarding NFTs and metadata is the ""pointer to a pointer approach"" as described in [HIP-10](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-10)

The first pointer is to a JSON file hosted via IPFS. Set the `metadata `field on the NFT to the JSON file's CID (aka IPFS hash link or IPFS URI). This is done during token creation with HTS. An example can be seen here https://hedera.com/blog/get-started-with-the-hedera-token-service-part-1-how-to-mint-nfts

The JSON file can then contain an array of other metadata defining the NFT's properties/attributes. Again, I recommend you reference HIP-10 for best practices and standards. 

The `image ` property/attribute in the JSON file should be set to another IPFS link which points to the image to be used as the NFT. 

Now you see why I call it ""a pointer to a pointer"" since the metadata property on the NFT points to a JSON file on IPFS which then points to the image file on IPFS. Hope this helps!","","üíØ (1)"

created an `index.js` with the following
```
require(""dotenv"").config({ path: '.env' });

const {
    Client,
    PrivateKey,
    AccountId
} = require(""@hashgraph/sdk"");

async function main() {

    // get environment variables

    const operatorPrivateKey = PrivateKey.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_KEY);

    // setup the client for testnet
    let client = Client.forTestnet();
    client.setOperator(operatorAccountId, operatorPrivateKey);

    console.log(""Done"")

added a `.env` file with my testnet operator/key

The NftAllowance message is used to modify the NFT serial number list for a spender. If the NFT serial number is positive then the NFT will be added to the approved list. Conversely if the serial number is negative the NFT will be removed from the approved list.

If the caller wants to remove all serial numbers from the approved list the approvedForAll field should be set to false. If the approvedForAll field is set to true, the serial number list for the spender will also be purged as the spender is granted access to all NFT instances and an enumeration is not required.

Q1. You'd transfer your tokens back to treasury (or another account) before dissociating. It would be wrong to automatically burn tokens on disassociation since it could break the ""rules"" of the token as set by its creator.
Q2. The transfer will occur irrespective of the receipt (unless it goes wrong for a number of possible reasons). You can skip getting a receipt and check the transaction occurred on a mirror after a few seconds to confirm this.","",""

is it possible to automatically drip a token to account holders every week based on a certain rate, a rate that changes over time mathematically?

"858141398473375754","Ed Marquez#6403","03/24/2022 3:29 PM","Hey @jaycool glad you're having fun with the JS SDK! 

As usual, the documentation is the best guide to understand who needs to sign specific transactions. As an example, this page (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/tokens/mint-a-token) about `TokenMintTransaction()` has a section on transaction signing requirements. That information is documented for each tx module in the SDK. 

For the second part of your question, the treasury account of a token receives the initial supply of the token upon creation and any other tokens minted/burned after token creation (more details here). The Treasury must sign the token creation because they have to authorize that they'll be receiving the newly created tokens. 
You don't want users being the treasury of a token without knowing about it or without authorizing it üòÇ Thus the treasury signing requirement.

Your understanding of the client is correct. The client interacts with the Hedera network (sends/receives txs, confirmations, queries, etc. and pays the corresponding network fees). When you use  `.execute(client)` the client automatically signs that transaction or query regardless of being free or paid and then submits it to the network - that is documented here https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/transactions/submit-a-transaction.","","üëç (1)"

If I mint an NFT and assign a supply key, then later reset the private key of that supply account, it seems that you can no longer burn the NFT for which that account was assigned as the supply key. Neither the new or old key will work. Is this expected? And If so, is there a fallback recommendation e.g. can the admin key burn instead for example?","",""

3. Yes, it does. See line 61 in this example: https://github.com/ed-marquez/quick-contract-examples/blob/master/0_transferHbar2Contract_viaCryptoTransfer.js

With the JS SDK, an `AccountInfoQuery()` (that's a paid query though) tells you the tokens associated with an account in the TokenRelations field. A free way to get this info would be doing a mirror node query (see this article for info on how https://hedera.com/blog/how-to-look-up-transaction-history-on-hedera-using-mirror-nodes-back-to-the-basics) for account balances. That query returns a `tokens` field with that shows the tokens associated with an account. See details here: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/mirror-node-api/rest-api#balances-1. From there, you can do some logic to test whether the token ID in question is already in that list of associated tokens.

2. That's expected as the submission of those transactions still consume computational resources. If you look at the payments associated with the tx in more depth, you'll see that only a portion of fees are charged (network fee and nodefee  i belive, not service fee). All txs and query feeson Hedera have those three components.","",""

 I'd suggest looking at some of the files in this directory (https://github.com/ed-marquez/hedera-dapp-days/tree/main/src/components/hedera) to get an idea of how to work with the HashConnect signer/provider, which simplifies the process of signing and executing transaction with your wallet a lot!","",""

Please do keep in mind there are fundamentally two types of transactions:
  1. Transactions that just change the state of existing entities; vs,
  2. Transactions that create new entities.

An analogy might be: 
  1. Making a payment with an existing credit card; vs, 
  2. Getting a new credit card.
Clearly, there will always be a much lower TPS on the second category! üòÅ (When VISA says its payment network can handle 25k TPS, they only mean they can handle such usage spikes from existing accounts; not that they could open new accounts for everyone on earth in a matter of days.)

So with the hashgraph consensus algorithm, we believe we can scale to 100k+ TPS of small transactions of the first type in a single shard. But there will always be a much lower ceiling on fast---or how long---any network can keep creating new entities; e.g. the 50M NFT situation we had on testnet earlier.

The Hedera council has chosen the current TPS limits on `*Create` transactions based on tradeoffs between user requirements, the node hardware specs, the technical limits of the current software, and the economics of our pricing model. 

This is quite a complicated calculus, as you can imagine! It sounds like you've already discussed with Greg that one (maybe questionable) aspect of the current policy is that all of `TokenCreate`, `AccountCreate`, `TopicCreate`, and `ScheduleCreate` are competing for the **same network capacity**. So if someone is creating a lot of accounts, it might take a lot of re-tries (more than 10) to successfully create a scheduled transaction.

All of this will keep evolving---and as the software keeps improving, I personally expect all our TPS limits to move up noticeably.

But there will always be periods of congestion where, even if a network has plenty of capacity for type (1) transactions, it is still throttling type (2) transactions.","","üëçüèª (1)"

 - In a single `TokenUpdate`, replace *both* the admin and wipe keys of the NFT collection with this public key.
 - Now to wipe an NFT in this collection, you would have to invert the SHA-512 hash function, which is...going to take a while.

The safest thing you can do to avoid this issue is assuming you are still within the valid duration to be able to resend the transaction - resend it with the same transaction ID and everything after the first processed transaction would be rejected as a duplicate. 

If the valid duration has expired and you still aren't aware if the transaction reached consensus you could potentially use a mirror to check the status of the transaction","",""

I posted an update to this GitHub issue. I was able to get an allowance approval and transfer to run successfully by** changing the client for the *allowance transfer *to be the spender**. IMO that seems to be the cause of the bug. See details:
https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js/issues/1202

Basically, the allowance approval goes through successfully (no issues there) and can be verified via mirror node (not SDK query - likely another bug that I'll report). The `TransferTransaction()` is what requires the client change when you use `addApprovedHbarTransfer()`.

Now, I simplified this problem to isolate the issue. I believe you (or maybe another user?) were trying to do this for an HTS token and via the precompile...

Associate a token to contract address(address(this)) within the contract works(from its exposed external functions) using HTS.

However, If I do the same thing in delegated method(delegated HTS service) it throws INVALID_SIGNATURE = 7; // The transaction signature is not valid

I tried with other account(not contract) addresses with proper signing key, similar method in that contract works.

Do we need a special handling to associate a token with contract address while using delegated HTS service?

Code example - 

Does not work and gives INVALID_SIGNATURE.

function associateToken external {
    tokenService.associateTokenPublic(address(this), _tokenA);
}

where tokenService injected as constructor argument -

constructor(IBaseHTS _tokenService) {

However, below works -

function associateToken external {

Here's some background to help clarify: 
- **HTS tokens exist natively on the Hedera ledger**. Precompiles (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/smart-contracts/hedera-service-solidity-libraries) enable smart contracts deployed on Hedera to operate on/with those native HTS tokens. You can also interact with HTS tokens as if they were ERCs with the supported ERC calls (https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/smart-contracts/supported-erc-token-standards). However, HTS functionality (like kyc, freeze, update, etc.) doesn't work on ERC tokens.

- On the other hand, an ERC on Hedera is just a smart contract. That ERC token exists within the scope of the contract. Account balances and things like that are kept in the contract, not natively on the ledger.","",""

"257905800964472833","Justyn#3610","08/16/2022 3:57 PM","@littletarzan  OK, had a play. Here's what I used:
```
const keylist = KeyList.of();
let transaction = await new TokenUpdateTransaction()
    .setTokenId(""0.0.47907576"")
    .setAdminKey(keylist)
    .freezeWithSigner(wallet);

transaction = await transaction.signWithSigner(wallet);
```

Results of trying to modify the different keys.

`setAdminKey`: Updates the key to this and the token becomes immutable.
```
""admin_key"": { 
    ""_type"": ""ProtobufEncoded"",
    ""key"": ""3200""
}
```
`setKycKey`: Error: INVALID_KYC_KEY
`setPauseKey`: Transaction success but not change to the key
`setWipeKey`: Error: INVALID_WIPE_KEY
`setFreezeKey`: Error: INVALID_FREEZE_KEY
`setFeeScheduleKey`: Error: INVALID_CUSTOM_FEE_SCHEDULE_KEY

So, yes, you can change the admin key to whatever `ProtobufEncoded 3200` is and the Token is then immutable but it doesn't cleanly remove the key. You could send a random key in the update and achieve the same thing I think.

You can't change any of the other keys with the same technique.

Good to know about this but I think the HIP would help still by creating some simple functions for removing the keys.

The HIP has been submitted for review here if anyone was interested in taking a look: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/pull/540","",""

Well it is good, but it is not good if we need some complex smart contract. HTS allow create token in very very simple way like a name price etc. If i wish to create a lot of complex functions or overriding and so on, it is not allowed. Unless i not found it when i researched, if i could write some solidity contract and use in HTS please give me more info, i'll do additional research. That's why we asking is it good way to use ethereum style? like a ERC20/721/1155 and so on. is there any chance that we could loose anything some data, tokens and so on if it will be stored in hedera network? i saw previous answer about CEX. this is critical and the most important question: if we would like to list tokens in the future on some CEX it must be ONLY HTS or is it ok to use in ERC20 way? it depends how we need to continue our development from this point. thank you so much","",""

From the use case you've proposed it sounds like the best option would be to follow similar logic to some NFT mints where the user goes to site (in your case clicks the create button), then they get prompted to associate the token, then (possibly after another click) you could send them the token.

There was recently a HIP for atomic transactions that you may be interested in but I'm not sure how far along it is so the better option might be to just follow the same process as other NFT mints but with the extra step of you creating the token (do you mean creating a token inside an existing collection or a completely new token?

What you'd need to do is after the user clicks you would create the token and then prompt the user to sign the association using hashpack (I'd recommend reading the hashpack docs or asking in the hashpack discord if there are tutorials to show you how to do this).

After the user has associated you could then either send them the token/s without them having to sign anything or if they are supposed to pay you'd generate another transaction for them to sign in hashpack","","üëç (1)"

- This would enable transferring tokens to that account for which you don't have the keys and then wipe the tokens in that account with the wipe key. 
- The caveat is that this could give unnecessary wiping power to an admin to wipe any account (which is necessary for certain use cases), but it would effectively do what you're trying to accomplish (based on what I understood from the question)

From docs: https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/tokens/wipe-a-token

We want to avoid any keys that may be either used or perceived to allow any negative permissions for the token creator (i.e. supply key would allow us to re-mint any burned tokens up to the max supply, wipe would allow us to wipe any account, etc)

A network-wide burn account would be the next best after that, although for now we are planning on creating our own burn account by adding so many keys its impossible to sign a transaction without getting throwing a TRANSACTION_OVERSIZE error. 

The only risk then would be that the burn account gets deleted once auto-renewal is activated which I think results in the tokens being returned to the treasury, but afaik this can be avoided by other users topping up the burn account if necessary","",""

Solution:
- in the `test` contract (https://github.com/ed-marquez/quick-contract-examples/blob/master/0_test.sol), see lines 12, 34, and 58 - basically, had to use  `delegatecall` 
- When using the `ContractExecuteTransaction` in the JS files, the token owner (treasury) must be the client so that it's the `msg.sender` calling the precompile (because of delegatecall)


Why the issue occurs:
- When you call the `approve` precompile, the precompile works with the sender of the transaction (the `test` contract in this case) 
- `test` contract is not associated to the token, and this is why the error is received","",""

The token association via Smart contract doesn't seem to be working for me. It did appear to be working (I get SUCCESS result for HederaTokenService.associateToken) but when I try and transfer the token to the smart contract address I get a TOKEN_NOT_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT

I have two functions that I'm experimenting with. One has payable and one without. The smart contract has enough HBAR balance in it (20+ HBAR)

**Smart contract**

```function associate_token_test(address token) public returns (int responseCode) {
      return HederaTokenService.associateToken(address(this), token);
}

function associate_token_test_payable(address token) public payable returns (int responseCode) {
      return HederaTokenService.associateToken(address(this), token);
}```

**Javascript**

```js
async function testAssociateTokenSC() {
    
    const operatorId    = AccountId.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_ID);
    const operatorKey   = PrivateKey.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_PVKEY);
    const client        = Client.forTestnet().setOperator(operatorId, operatorKey);
    const contractId    = ContractId.fromString(process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
    const tokenId       = TokenId.fromString(process.env.TOKEN_ID);

    const contractExecTx = new ContractExecuteTransaction()
    .setGas(100000)
    .setContractId(contractId)
    .setFunction(""associate_token_test"", new ContractFunctionParameters().addAddress(tokenId.toSolidityAddress()));

    const submitExecTx  = await contractExecTx.execute(client);
    const receiptTx     = await submitExecTx.getReceipt(client);

    console.log(""testAssociateTokenSC result: "" + receiptTx.status.toString()); //I get a 'SUCCESS' here
}

async function testAssociateTokenSCPayable() {
    
    const operatorId    = AccountId.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_ID);
    const operatorKey   = PrivateKey.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_PVKEY);
    const client        = Client.forTestnet().setOperator(operatorId, operatorKey);
    const contractId    = ContractId.fromString(process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
    const tokenId       = TokenId.fromString(process.env.TOKEN_ID);

    const contractExecTx = new ContractExecuteTransaction()
    .setGas(100000)
    .setContractId(contractId)
    .setFunction(""associate_token_test_payable"", new ContractFunctionParameters().addAddress(tokenId.toSolidityAddress()))
    .setPayableAmount(Hbar.from(2));

    const submitExecTx  = await contractExecTx.execute(client);
    const receiptTx     = await submitExecTx.getReceipt(client);

    console.log(""testAssociateTokenSCPayable result: "" + receiptTx.status.toString()); //I also get a `SUCCESS` HERE
}
```

And then afterwards, I tried this but didn't have success

```js
async function testTransferTokenToSC() {
 
    const operatorId        = AccountId.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_ID);
    const operatorKey       = PrivateKey.fromString(process.env.OPERATOR_PVKEY);
    const client            = Client.forTestnet().setOperator(operatorId, operatorKey);
    //const contractId        = ContractId.fromString(process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS); //also tried using this for the 'to'
    const contractAccountId = AccountId.fromString(process.env.SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
    const tokenId           = TokenId.fromString(process.env.TOKEN_ID);

    const transaction2 = new TransferTransaction()
    .addTokenTransfer(tokenId, operatorId, -10)
    .addTokenTransfer(tokenId, contractAccountId, 10)
    .freezeWith(client);

   const signTx2 = await transaction2.sign(operatorKey);
   const txResponse2 = await signTx2.execute(client);
   const receipt2 = await txResponse2.getReceipt(client);
   const transactionStatus2 = receipt2.status;

   console.log(""testTransferTokenToSC status: "" + transactionStatus2.toString()); //TOKEN_NOT_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT
}```

"763487385504841758","aseidma#2141","10/13/2022 11:09 AM","Hello everyone,
currently trying to implement a smart contract that creates a non fungible token for `msg.sender` and is afterwards able to mint NFTs for that sender as well (experiencing issues).
If I create the token with the contract as the treasurer, minting works fine. The issue comes up when I create a token with the sender as treasury and then try to mint via a separate function call.

This is the mint function on the SC:
```
    function mintNft(address token, bytes[] memory metadata)
        external
        returns (int64)
    {
        (int256 response, , int64[] memory serials) = HederaTokenService
            .mintToken(token, 0, metadata);

        if (response != HederaResponseCodes.SUCCESS) {
            revert(""Failed to mint non-fungible token."");
        }

        return serials[0];
    }
```

HTS returns error 327 (""The full prefix signature for precompile is not valid"").  The documentation for HTS's `mintToken` states: ""Mints an amount of the token to the defined treasury account"".
What is the ""defined treasury account""? The function does not accept it as a parameter and precompile is called using a delegatecall, meaning `msg.sender` should be the person who executed the contract, which in my case is the address assigned to `token.treasury` when creating the token.

Is it currently even possible to mint NFTs directly on the account of `msg.sender` via a smart contract using HTS?","",""

Native hedera transactions only need the first few bytes of the public key to figure out which key signed the transaction (this improves privacy) but the EVM implementation can't figure this out as implemented.

my later point is that if the Contract knows it is going to fail ie be removed then it can/could return all the Assets to all the orig sendings Accounts prior to removal...    how ? it needs gas and there is none as thats why the autorenew fail was tripped ie 0 balance and it needs self awareness and to pay gas to store such tran records..mappings/arrays..   unfeasible.

read my last msg.. its a core architecture issue ..   whomever came up with last year this 'rented immutability' .. which is misnomered... has to re-wrestle how Assets can be held safe to ABFT immutably .. not rented.. immutable..  see it ?

but..yes, it gets worse if its a Contract that others enter into with their Tokens...        If a friend says he bought the house with Cash and (he doesnt tell you that he didnt or wont pay the County Taxes) ... and all is fine to move the family in and priceless toys.. and he gets the notice to vacate but doesnt tell you of course..  the next thing you know the Sheriff shows up BUT you cant remove your kids toys and they are returned to County (Token)Treasury/ or to your friend whom 'owns' the house but has since moved to Panama.

i want to create a token where rewards points users generate are stored in a mapping with their wallet addresses, and add a ""redeem"" function where tokens are sent to the user's wallet based on their reward count. i figured this could easily be done by creating a token contract with mappings for the user's reward points, and the user's token balance and updating both fields accordingly (how i would do it for Ethereum/ERC20) 

i know i can just create a separate contract that does the mappings and utilizes the HTS to facilitate the token movement but I was wondering if i could keep everything contained within a single token contract as i described","",""

yes, might depend on how much wallet to wallet activity and volume you forsee and of course HTS in-Hedera eco-system exchange listings etc/ Saucey üòâ swap DEX usage etc. 

A composite might be most efficient .. make calls to the HTS token from a Contract that simply yes keeps mappings of the addr and HTS amounts...  I'd just be aware that if your Users use other wallets to send those HTS tokens - apart from your own platform wallet.. then if your balances in your contract's mappings is related to a Users balance.. they'd only get rewards/action based on the balances held in your Contract's mapping..   which they may no longer own as your Contract is not updated by other 3rd part wallets..  see that ?","",""

Then employ a bridge in the platforms' DApp .. atomic, to permit those ERC20 balances to be bridged to a HTS token of same name etc..   ie issue the HTS and deduct the ERC20 balance mapping as usual.    Then a reverse swap back HTS to ERC20 .. this way you permit in-eco system playing about.. dex's exchanges etc.. 3rd party HTS wallet usage etc..   but the platforms ecosystem core is all ERC20 based patterns.

- If a token has **KYC enabled**, then a user must be approved (grant KYC) before he/she can ever participate in transactions with that token. That authorization requirement applies to all potential token users as well - from the first transaction to all subsequent ones. You can revoke KYC for a previously approved user, which prevents that user from transacting the token again. Granting KYC is like approval/authorization to transact (once certain conditions are met, like proving ID, etc.) for any and all users. e.g. A centralized exchange requires you to show ID before you can buy their token (KYC granted when you show ID).

- **Token Freeze/Unfreeze** functionality only applies to an individual account you specify - it doesn't necessarily affect any other accounts. 
It can be done after the user has already transacted the token. 
e.g. a video game freezes an account for 1 day because the user committed a penalty.","",""

It appears the network wants all fee-collecting accounts to sign the token-create transaction. This is **different** from NFT creation. I have tried via HTS precompile in Solidity and also using the JS API. Creation works for a single custom fee that is the operator but adding a second then it fails (unless you sign the create transaction with the other account). I guess I can use my multi-sig implementation to make this happen but it seems odd to me that collecting accounts need to sign it for an FT but do not have to for an NFT.","",""

This is actually as expected. I forgot to add the context that these fees are being paid in the newly generated token.

Our entire codebase compares longs using x > y rather than java.lang.Long.compareUnsigned(x,y) > 0.

Converting the entire codebase to the latter would reduce readability, and it would be fragile: there‚Äôs a good chance someone would write code in the future with > out of force of habit.

It‚Äôs also likely that users of the our Java SDK will use > in their code, which would be a subtle bug that might not be caught right away.

So, since int64 works for all users and uint64 only works for some users, we made the decision at the beginning that HAPI would consistently use only signed types. To be maximally useful to the maximum number of users.

I would recommend reading this article on royalties: https://hedera.com/blog/nft-royalty-fees-hedera-hashgraph as it explains a lot and has code examples that may help you.

My summary:
* If an NFT has a fallback fee embedded then both sender and receiver have to sign with their account PrivateKey. 
* If there is no fallback then the NFT can be sent without payment as long as the receiver has the token associated. 
* If there is a payment involved that is to be atomic - within the same transaction as the NFT transfer - then both sides will have to sign again [there can be 10 'legs' to a transaction as an example  1) send hbar 2 ) receive hbar 3-10) send NFT so you can send 8 NFT serials per transaction if there is payment involved]","","ü§ù (2)"

if that transfer occurs then you know the treasury key is good, so flip it around and send some hbar back to tsry from Alice to test the Alice key:

I assumed it would be this but no luck for me üò• 
https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1792/allowances/tokens

If we allow an Hbar crypto allowance like this:

```
let transaction = new AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction()
    .approveHbarAllowance(
      ownerAccountId,
      spenderAccountId,
      new Hbar(200, HbarUnit.Hbar)
    )
    .freezeWith(client);
```
then this can be checked here:
https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1792/allowances/crypto

and we see the allowance:
```
{
  ""allowances"": [
    {
      ""owner"": ""0.0.1792"",
      ""spender"": ""0.0.2669"",
      ""timestamp"": { ""from"": ""1675171133.316335530"", ""to"": null },
      ""amount_granted"": 20000000000
    }
  ],
  ""links"": { ""next"": null }
}

```

However, when using the nft equivalent:

```
let transaction = new AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction()
    .approveTokenNftAllowanceAllSerials(
      tokenToAllow,
      ownerAccountId,
      spenderAccountId
    )
    .freezeWith(client);
```

I would expect to see the allowance here:
https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1792/allowances/tokens

but I only get an empty array
```
{""allowances"":[],""links"":{""next"":null}}
```

which is strange as I am able to successfully transfer the NFT using the spender account like so:
```
const transferTransaction = new TransferTransaction()
    .addApprovedNftTransfer(
      new NftId(tokenToAllow, 3),
      ownerAccountId,
      customerAccountId
    ).freezeWith(client);

- I agree with you on the benefit of being able to see information about allowances for NFTs, just like for HBAR and FTs. I'd encourage adding an issue to the mirror node repo to start that conversation with the engineering team. 

- Adrian, `AccountAllowanceDeleteTransaction` does work. However, this one is tricky for NFTs because the implementation in the SDK follows the ERC-721  standard. Because of that standard not all scenarios are covered; for instance, if you approve **all NFT**s for a spender, then you can't remove the allowance for **individual serials**. From doc (https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/docs/sdks/cryptocurrency/adjust-an-allowance#methods), you see that this only has one method (`deleteAllNftAllowance()`). So, what works is to approve serials 1 by 1 and remove them 1 by 1. 

Here are a few tutorials on allowances: https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/resources/tutorials#accounts-keys-and-hbar
Here's one on allowances for tokens with the SDKs: https://hedera.com/blog/how-to-approve-fungible-token-and-nft-allowances-on-hedera-part-1-using-the-sdk","","‚ù§Ô∏è (2)"

The most recent TokenCreate API at https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/docs/hedera-api/token-service/tokencreate lists 21 properties you can use to create a token. It is unclear which of these are required. The whitepaper at https://hedera.com/hh_tokenization-whitepaper_v2_20210101.pdf lists a fewer number of properties (12), but does list `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `treasury account`, `token renewal account`, and `initial supply` as required or mandatory. Should I assume this same set of six properties are the only required ones to create a token?

Also, side question -- is the correct term for these token features  *field*, *attribute*,  *property*, or ???.  The SDK listed above uses *field*. The HIP-412 (https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-412#required-optional-and-conditionally-optional-fields) also uses *field*, but Michael Mulders' discussion about Hedera NFT Metada (https://hedera.com/blog/hedera-nft-metadata-hip412) uses *property*.","",""

The whitepaper lists HTS as being an easy and superfast way to create native Hedera tokens. This tutorial on Guarda (https://guarda.com/academy/tutorials/hedera-token-service-how-to-hold-hbar-tokens/ ) adds that part of the reason for native token speed is that there's no requirement for a smart contract to deploy them. The whitepaper goes on to say that to native hedera tokens have interoperability with any other token, whether on the Hedera network or on some other DLT. 

My question then, is this: Are Hedera smart contracts required in order to take advantage of this interoperability with tokens on non-Hedera DLTs? Thanks.","",""

You can deploy an ERC721/ERC20 if you like but would be a worse user experience given the infrastructure is built here to take advantage of native HTS tokens instead. Using SC on Hedera that leverage HTS directly allows for some solid encapsulation and decentralization use cases that get you the best of both worlds.

Interoperability on other chains is more of a bridge question. I believe Hashport has successfully implemented - caveat that I have not used it! - a path to bridge tokens to other EVM chains; again not sure the list I have only ever player moving hbar across. In that case on the other side there would need to be a SC implementation if that chain did not have a native token service equivalence.","","üôè (1)"

2) as per 1) run the launchpad but mint the NFTs 'on demand'. Note the transactions will be sequential and not atomic.

If a single trade has NFTs from different collections then it is not obvious who gets what in royalties but you may be able to derive from empirical testing.

---
From your example the FT/NFT has been sent from -589 -> -590 with no economic value offered against it so the fallback fee (and min FT fee) as both paid?

The FT custom fee is paid denominated in itself so it can only charge 10% of itself (min 100)

The NFT fee is 10% of any hbar exchanged in the transaction, with 100hbar fallback (so fallback is paid)

The bit that seems odd to me is -589 is paying a further 10 hbar although looking at that it might just be an additional leg in your transaction that was intentional?","",""

I found that the `transfers/` api call will include `token_transfers` but not `nft_transfers` which is only included when calling `transfers/{id}`. I have found this issue talking about it: https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/issues/4099.
My question would be, understanding that `transfers/` does not include `nft_transfers`, and querying `transfers/{id}` for every transaction submitted to the network just to see if it contains nft transfers is not feasible; Is there another way in which to approach the problem to be able to detect and index nft transfers in real time?","",""

The challenge with a general purpose database containing large data sets is that you often have to tune it to work for certain queries which makes other queries non-performant. 
Another solution is data duplication which on large datasets has an increased storage cost and reduces the speed at which the data can be written to the database (you're writing it twice).

There is a graphql endeavour which may help you solve your requirement (https://www.hgraph.io/)

Depending on your use case, running a custom mirror that tracks only the transactions you're interested into and stores the data in a manner that's efficient for your use case may also make sense.","",""
