Our entire codebase compares longs using x > y rather than java.lang.Long.compareUnsigned(x,y) > 0.

Converting the entire codebase to the latter would reduce readability, and it would be fragile: there’s a good chance someone would write code in the future with > out of force of habit.

It’s also likely that users of the our Java SDK will use > in their code, which would be a subtle bug that might not be caught right away.

So, since int64 works for all users and uint64 only works for some users, we made the decision at the beginning that HAPI would consistently use only signed types. To be maximally useful to the maximum number of users.

I would recommend reading this article on royalties: https://hedera.com/blog/nft-royalty-fees-hedera-hashgraph as it explains a lot and has code examples that may help you.

My summary:
* If an NFT has a fallback fee embedded then both sender and receiver have to sign with their account PrivateKey. 
* If there is no fallback then the NFT can be sent without payment as long as the receiver has the token associated. 
* If there is a payment involved that is to be atomic - within the same transaction as the NFT transfer - then both sides will have to sign again [there can be 10 'legs' to a transaction as an example  1) send hbar 2 ) receive hbar 3-10) send NFT so you can send 8 NFT serials per transaction if there is payment involved]","","🤝 (2)"

I would strip this back to test the treasury key, comment out your transfer and just use an hbar tx:

        .addHbarTransfer(treasuryId, -1)

    const transferSubmit = await transferSigned.execute(client);
    const transferRx = await transferSubmit.getReceipt(client);

if that transfer occurs then you know the treasury key is good, so flip it around and send some hbar back to tsry from Alice to test the Alice key:

```
        const transferTx = new TransferTransaction()
        .addHbarTransfer(aliceId, -0.1)
        .addHbarTransfer(treasuryId, 0.1)

        transferTx.sign(alickey);

- if you specify a key list, then all keys m must sign the relevant transactions (m out of m)

I assumed it would be this but no luck for me 😥 
https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1792/allowances/tokens

If we allow an Hbar crypto allowance like this:

```
let transaction = new AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction()
    .approveHbarAllowance(
      ownerAccountId,
      spenderAccountId,
      new Hbar(200, HbarUnit.Hbar)
    )
    .freezeWith(client);
```
then this can be checked here:
https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1792/allowances/crypto

and we see the allowance:
```
{
  ""allowances"": [
    {
      ""owner"": ""0.0.1792"",
      ""spender"": ""0.0.2669"",
      ""timestamp"": { ""from"": ""1675171133.316335530"", ""to"": null },
      ""amount_granted"": 20000000000
    }
  ],
  ""links"": { ""next"": null }
}

```

However, when using the nft equivalent:

```
let transaction = new AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction()
    .approveTokenNftAllowanceAllSerials(
      tokenToAllow,
      ownerAccountId,
      spenderAccountId
    )
    .freezeWith(client);
```

I would expect to see the allowance here:
https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/accounts/0.0.1792/allowances/tokens

but I only get an empty array
```
{""allowances"":[],""links"":{""next"":null}}
```

which is strange as I am able to successfully transfer the NFT using the spender account like so:
```
const transferTransaction = new TransferTransaction()
    .addApprovedNftTransfer(
      new NftId(tokenToAllow, 3),
      ownerAccountId,
      customerAccountId
    ).freezeWith(client);
```

Am I missing something here or is the mirror node endpoint broken for the listing of account allowance tokens?","",""

- I agree with you on the benefit of being able to see information about allowances for NFTs, just like for HBAR and FTs. I'd encourage adding an issue to the mirror node repo to start that conversation with the engineering team. 

- Adrian, `AccountAllowanceDeleteTransaction` does work. However, this one is tricky for NFTs because the implementation in the SDK follows the ERC-721  standard. Because of that standard not all scenarios are covered; for instance, if you approve **all NFT**s for a spender, then you can't remove the allowance for **individual serials**. From doc (https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/docs/sdks/cryptocurrency/adjust-an-allowance#methods), you see that this only has one method (`deleteAllNftAllowance()`). So, what works is to approve serials 1 by 1 and remove them 1 by 1. 

Here are a few tutorials on allowances: https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/resources/tutorials#accounts-keys-and-hbar
Here's one on allowances for tokens with the SDKs: https://hedera.com/blog/how-to-approve-fungible-token-and-nft-allowances-on-hedera-part-1-using-the-sdk","","❤️ (2)"

The most recent TokenCreate API at https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/docs/hedera-api/token-service/tokencreate lists 21 properties you can use to create a token. It is unclear which of these are required. The whitepaper at https://hedera.com/hh_tokenization-whitepaper_v2_20210101.pdf lists a fewer number of properties (12), but does list `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `treasury account`, `token renewal account`, and `initial supply` as required or mandatory. Should I assume this same set of six properties are the only required ones to create a token?

Also, side question -- is the correct term for these token features  *field*, *attribute*,  *property*, or ???.  The SDK listed above uses *field*. The HIP-412 (https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-412#required-optional-and-conditionally-optional-fields) also uses *field*, but Michael Mulders' discussion about Hedera NFT Metada (https://hedera.com/blog/hedera-nft-metadata-hip412) uses *property*.","",""

This tutorial on Guarda (https://guarda.com/academy/tutorials/hedera-token-service-how-to-hold-hbar-tokens/ ) adds that part of the reason for native token speed is that there's no requirement for a smart contract to deploy them. The whitepaper goes on to say that to native hedera tokens have interoperability with any other token, whether on the Hedera network or on some other DLT. 

My question then, is this: Are Hedera smart contracts required in order to take advantage of this interoperability with tokens on non-Hedera DLTs? Thanks.","",""

You can deploy an ERC721/ERC20 if you like but would be a worse user experience given the infrastructure is built here to take advantage of native HTS tokens instead. Using SC on Hedera that leverage HTS directly allows for some solid encapsulation and decentralization use cases that get you the best of both worlds.

Interoperability on other chains is more of a bridge question. I believe Hashport has successfully implemented - caveat that I have not used it! - a path to bridge tokens to other EVM chains; again not sure the list I have only ever player moving hbar across. In that case on the other side there would need to be a SC implementation if that chain did not have a native token service equivalence.","","🙏 (1)"

If a single trade has NFTs from different collections then it is not obvious who gets what in royalties but you may be able to derive from empirical testing.

---
From your example the FT/NFT has been sent from -589 -> -590 with no economic value offered against it so the fallback fee (and min FT fee) as both paid?

The FT custom fee is paid denominated in itself so it can only charge 10% of itself (min 100)

The NFT fee is 10% of any hbar exchanged in the transaction, with 100hbar fallback (so fallback is paid)

The bit that seems odd to me is -589 is paying a further 10 hbar although looking at that it might just be an additional leg in your transaction that was intentional?","",""

The challenge with a general purpose database containing large data sets is that you often have to tune it to work for certain queries which makes other queries non-performant. 
Another solution is data duplication which on large datasets has an increased storage cost and reduces the speed at which the data can be written to the database (you're writing it twice).

There is a graphql endeavour which may help you solve your requirement (https://www.hgraph.io/)

> What is the default number of slots we should increase to?

#### Answer

Only set to 1, never more

#### Description

- Token Association is a security and spam-blocking feature
- When we set the max automatic token associations to a non-zero number we are opening the user up to receive un-associated tokens
- Non-zero max automatic token associations may result in the user receiving malicious or spam tokens
- We should only use this technique when necessary
- Make a best effort to avoid leaving a user's account in a state with a non-zero max automatic token associations

Account A & B both sign the same transaction, account B is identified as the Payer of the transaction.  That way account B will be charged the transaction fees.  If the token charges custom fees for transfers, you'll need to double check to ensure A still does not get charged one of those.  Note this does involve cooperation between the two wallets as signing a TX within a pre-determined time window due to the nature of how the low-level protocol works.

The other two ways to make it happen (allowances or scheduled transactions, aka secure trade) would require some fees to be paid by account A.  Account A would pay a fee to authorize the transfer, and B would pay the fee that actually causes the transfer to happen.","","leemon (1)"
